I would definitely buy the topcoat as my nail topcoat. The basecoat however did not dry and remain sticky I would not use it the topcoat is definitely worth the price and I would just get that,1

You would think they'd all kind of be the same, but take it from me, they're not. Sometimes the salts are very difficult to dissolve and don't have the same feel. But these flakes are awesome! They dissolve easily and make the water feel so soft and lovely. I feel wonderful after bathing in these salts.<br /><br />The package was popped open when it arrived, but I taped it up and it's held fine. Sometimes that happens with heavy bags being thrown in flimsy boxes.<br /><br />The bag says to use 3 cups, but I usually do about 2, because I prefer having expensive magnesium chloride flakes last a little longer. Two cups is quite sufficient and is what is recommended with many other brands.",1

It's clearly  a good quality sunscreen and experience has shown us that the odds for a Korean cosmetics product to be good are quite... good.<br />This sunscreen appears to be no exception. Texture is light and face feels good if used when spending a few hours at the pool or at the beach, and we tried both. And, yes, this is for face only, mostly because there's not much of it and it's not exactly cheap so enjoy it while it lasts.",1

But, thought I would give this one a try.<br /><br />It does a good job, but is a little large for an average cat.

They are a compact but work very well.  Nice and thick, but plastic so no worries of shattering them it they get dropped.  So far they have worked great and we have not had any issues.

It is very solidly made, the handle is sturdy and easy to hold and control. The three rows of bristles are arranged evenly and they are firmly attached within the brush. The bristles are stiff, yet have a bit softness to them. I have had no breakage or shedding of bristles at all with this brush. The arrangement of the bristles also allows for easy cleaning of the brush as well. The tapered handle makes parting and sectioning the hair easy, and the brush as a whole is well-balanced and easy to work with. I think the price is terrific for the quality of this brush, which I use on my natural hair and on wigs. I highly recommend it!",1

AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,B08F79Z1Q5,5,2021-04-17 01:15:01.752,Perfect for My COVID Cleaning :-),"In these COVID times, we've had shortages of some basic cleaning and health items. I started reading some blogs about how to make some easy cleansers with natural products, like castile soap. Since then, I've been whipping up cleaning solutions like I'm trying to earn a Ph.D. in Potions from Hogwarts :-).<br /><br />These sprays are a good easy size to hold and carry without cramping or hurting hand with the weight of liquid. Not huge like some cleaning bottle sprayers. The nozzles can be turned from mist to stream and everything in between. The tube reaches to the bottom, so there is less waste. The bottles are clear so you can fill them and monitor them easily.<br /><br />These probably won't last a lifetime, but I'm happy with them. Better than reusing old chemical-laden bottles when trying to go greener.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",1
AFGGRGHGHSFKMZASFBYFRHBBEOPA,B08NJ5BTWG,5,2021-04-17 02:47:46.551,Nice sunscreen.🕶,Nice lightweight sunscreen.  This is perfect for wearing under makeup and does not feel thick or oily.  It does leave behind a slightly dewy appearance and is not matte.  No white cast as seen with thicker formulas.  This feels very moisturizing without feeling heavy.  Blends very well into the skin and has a very mild scent.  Bottle is easy to use and to dispense product.  Great sunscreen,1

I never expect the pumps/spray to last forever, but I'm very happy with the ""life"" I do get from these.  I haven't experienced any issues with leaking.",1
AGADKXWLAJJ4FGWIDIWAPJL5A6HA,B08KG48M5L,5,2021-04-17 13:33:53.403,Easy To Use And Effective,"As a 42 year old woman with shockingly pale skin I thought it would be interesting to try a sunless tanner. When I was younger I used Jergens sunless tanner and unless I was extremely careful and diligent I ended up orange, streaked or some combination of the two. I did not have high hopes for this sunless tanner, so I started with a small area on one leg.<br /><br />First, this lotion does not have any real scent straight out of the bottle, but it does have a smell that develops once it is on the skin. It is not unpleasant and maybe the scent is dependent on the person, but it is there. Second, it is easy to apply. The first application I only put a tiny amount on my right leg and then immediately washed my hands. I let it dry for about one minute and then got dressed. Simple. Third, it takes a bit for color to appear. I started to tan in about 12 hours and by the next morning I was noticeably browner.<br /><br />The second application I put on both my legs just like normal lotion. I tried paying attention to my knees and ankles, but honestly, I did not really. I washed my hands immediately, but must have brushed my forearm. I let everything dry for about one minute and then got dressed. The next morning I was tan and had a streak of brown on my arm.<br /><br />I like this stuff. It is easy to use and the color lasts. My super pale skin accepts the color and I don't look nearly as translucent.",1

AGNMJIU3VXBRQMQG6JJQYPQBI2ZQ,B08Y6HCR5G,5,2021-04-17 20:21:38.933,Great for thick hair,"Love these hair ties. You get a great assortment of the spiral cord, regular cotton ties and one small pink scrunchie. They do a good job of keeping my thick hair up without tugging on my hair. Usually I need 2 of the goodie brand hair ties to keep my hair up the way I want but just one of these ties does the trick. They’re are a tad tight to keep on my wrist but the ties come in a nice carrying bag. With goodie hair ties I usually stretchy them out after 10+ uses. Hoping these will be durable. For the price, it’s a great deal!",1
AGNMJIU3VXBRQMQG6JJQYPQBI2ZQ,B08NJ5BTWG,5,2021-04-18 00:07:51.543,Great for my oily skin!,"I’m loving this sunscreen so far! It’s lightweight and leaves a nice matte/satin finish on my skin. It actually doesn’t make my skin oily nor leave a whitecast. The product feels like a lotion that glides on easy and absorbs well into my skin. There’s almost no scent to it, which is a plus. It contains pretty good ingredients to prevent water loss and keeps the skin hydrated and reduces the look of wrinkles! Definitely will be my go-to summer sunscreen!",1
AH6JLX5SJSUOJBBT6RRE2RDXIG6A,B0863FZFPV,4,2021-04-18 02:00:40.833,Fun and pretty!,"The coloring looks really cool and pretty. I like that it's got the multiple colors, I personally haven't had many that do. The length and style combined with the colors is a lot of fun. It sheds a little. I try to be careful with the ends as they've been a little tangly but it's a costume wig so I often experience that with other costume wigs, especially with length and curls. Overall I really like it and think it looks good",1
AEH7RAIDBU7QALXTMWAA73PTL4JA,B08S1LWF9V,2,2021-04-18 06:28:23.406,I don’t do silicones (and petrolatum),"I heard a lot of good things about this brand but after trying it / seeing the ingredients list I wasn’t too happy. My favorite is the moisture essence with 100% plant based squalane. It doesn’t have anything else and that is the only product I don’t mind using on my skin. It doesn’t have any offensive scents and odors, and I like the way it makes my skin feel. That product is 5 stars for me. However, the other two, Skin Refiner and Moisture Boost, I am not sold on because of the ingredients. When I first used the skin refiner I loved how it felt - goes on smoothly, glides through my skin, and melts into it like butter. I looked at the ingredients only to see that it is, of course, filled with silicone (siloxane and petrolatum). I should have looked at it first before trying. I know studies may have shown that silicones are ok for skin, but for me personally I just don’t want that on my face. As for the petrolatum, that is something I just don’t want anywhere near my skin! While I loved the way it felt I didn’t feel good about the stuff in it. The skin refiner also made my skin itchy and tingly, even though I tried on three separate occasions, so I had to stop using it. The good thing about these products is they are fragrance free. Overall, I just did not like the two out of three items. I posted a list of the ingredients for anyone who needs to refer to it.",0
AHYOSWORVZFXM5QMRIAW3JTTFFIQ,B08F4ZDVZQ,5,2021-04-18 09:36:17.216,keeps my makeup from defining my wrinkles,"This is a nice small set, perfect for travel or just to try it out.<br />I just recently started using a Touch in Sol primer and I really liked it, so I decided to try these out.<br />Just like the other primer, these worked great on my skin. It went on smooth and absorbed quickly.<br />Not a lot is needed so a little will go a long way.<br />These helped with the appearance of my makeup. I had started noticing that my makeup was defining my wrinkles and damaged/large pores and making them more noticeable. The Touch in Sol primers has definitely improved how my makeup looks.",1
AE3X7PNUWXQU6FZQLQGIA6ZT45QA,B08QYW2FJ2,5,2021-04-18 09:40:44.280,Great Set,"I'm happy with the Fog-free Dental Mirror and 4 Pieces of Stainless Steel Dental Pick. It's packaged securely and all the pieces were in excellent condition upon arrival. I visit my dentist often, but I sometimes need a little help to find rogue bits of debris in some of my teeth. The dental mirror is incredibly handy for that use. I also find the dental picks are better for me as hobby tools. I've never felt the need to scrap my own teeth to risk damage to surrounding tissues. They do a good job in tiny crevices and have a textured handle which is easy to hold. I find this set to be a good value and the versatile use is a great bonus for me.",1
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,B08LPC1G23,4,2021-04-18 13:50:07.681,Works very well,This is a neat little curling iron that does the work for you really. I have tried some different types of curling irons over the year and wanted something easy and simple to use. My hair is quite long these days and when you have longer hair it gets a little bit more complicated I found. So I wanted to give this one a chance and see how it goes. There is definitely a slight learning curve but watch the video and off you go.<br /><br />The temperature adjustment is at the handle and is very easy to use by rotating it. The tip is insulated so you can actually touch it which is a nice added touch in my eyes. There is also an adjustment that lets you switch if it turns left or right when making the curls so you can switch that as well depending on which way you want your curls to go. It comes with 3 different barrels that lets you change the type of curls you get.<br /><br />I found it works quite well and is easy to use. I had no issues with my long hair because it has the long barrel to accommodate all my hair and actually curl it all. All in all I am quite happy with this.,1
AECIT3NMW6RKABFS6YOCYX4YUYOQ,B08N6YHQXT,4,2021-04-18 20:31:04.965,"Faint scent doesn't linger, good lather.","I like the ingredients, not super in love with the scent, but it's faint and doesn't linger, so no problem really. This worked up a good lather, not the best, but better than others with a washcloth; the lather didn't disappear either so I didn't need to keep going back to the soap. It's a nice size, larger than others I've tried, and seems like it will last at least a week, probably longer. Non-daily use it could last much longer. As far as moisturizing, I can at least say it didn't dry me out, which is a plus.",1

I love everything about this mirror. I use this mirror everyday for makeup to go. It is perfect and very sturdy. I have dropped this mirror twice and it hasn't broken.

These do the job and stay on pretty nicely but my niece complains that it bothers her behind her ears and she takes it off after about an hour give or take.

When used properly, the glove isn't needed but always nice to have as a precaution.<br /><br />It can get VERY hot which is a plus in some situations.<br /><br />The only glaring flaw is it doesn't ""glide"" as well over my wife's long hair like the previous models she's tried. It actually seems to snag and catch and isn't as ""smooth."" This is a potential dealbreaker for her. For someone with thinner and/or shorter hair it may not be as front and center, but if your hair is thicker/courser and/or longer it may pose a problem for you.<br /><br />3/5",0

This bracket allows my young scholars to hear the important sounds during phonics and phonemic learning.

First, the highlighted blonde matches my hair 100%. I know this won't be the case for everyone but I was shocked at how close it was to my ""natural"" color.  They arrived neatly packaged and it was really easy to seperate and keep them tangle free. The clips are also a great feature as they pop in and out with ease. I was easily able to work them in without the clips showing through my hair. I washed and air dried each piece after wearing and they was so easy to restyle. The price is a bit steep but considerably less than what I would expect to pay for good quality.<br />If you're a newbie and considering highlights, these are definitely a great place to start. I highly recommend!!",1

I can truly say that these magnesium salts really do make my feet feel so much better when dissolved in the foot bath water.  Because of my knees, I don't take baths any longer, but if I could easily sit down and get back up in the bath tub, I'd definitely try these salts in a nice long soak in the tub - I can imagine my whole body feeling as good as my feet afterwards!

If you've used Noxema to wash your face, it has a similar effect. Because I'm prone to dry skin, I had to apply cream immediately. The label on the bottle suggests washing with this, then using a toner, followed by Vitamin C. Makes sense as your skin is stripped of everything and is ready for some TLC. I think this is an ideal wash for people with oily or combination skin. For me, this will be a great summer wash to control the shine (oil).

Once I am done using this soap during showering, the scent lingers for little while before disappearing.<br /><br />The soap gives a creamy, rich lather.<br /><br />My skin is typically of a dry nature, due in part to the hard water that is prevalent in our region. After using nearly all this soap in the past 3 weeks, I like that the soap helps my skin not be excessively dried out.<br /><br />On the product description page, in the ""important information"" section, there were only 2 ingredients listed: Calendula Extract & Coconut Oil (100% Natural Ingrediants).<br /><br />However, on the back of the product box, here are all the ingredients listed: sodium palmate, sodium palm, kernelate, aqua, glycerin, perfume, titanium dioxide, HEDP 60%, tinogard TT, tinopal CBS-X, extract of calendula and coconut oil.

I like that one serving delivers 10 mg of collagen but it's only one type - bovine collagen.  I think it's kind of pricey coming in at $34.95 (as of this review) since I've reviewed collagen powders that contains several types of collagen and were more than 9.3 oz for as much or even less money.  Also, you won't see any results in 2 weeks so don't let those reviews get you all excited.  I've been consuming collagen on a daily basis for about a year and am now just beginning to see some positive changes in my skin and nails.  I'm 63 and realize all the collagen supplements in the world won't make me look 40 again but I have seen some improvements in less crinkly skin on my arms and some fine lines around my eyes looking much smoother.

You first wash your hair with the pre-treatment shampoo to clarify the hair and remove dirt and oils. At this point, make sure to detangle the hair well and section it into smaller parts so that you can apply the keratin treatment. The hair should be 80% towel dried. You then comb in the keratin treatment to each section of hair. I recommend wearing gloves. Allow it time to process and then blow dry and finish with a flat iron. The hair came out quite silky and smooth, but it began to revert into fluffiness as the day went on. Adding a bit of hair oil helped to restrain the humidity.

I was using those picks but not only are they expensive BUT I noticed some of the plastic on it would be gone after using it on my teeth. Where was the plastic going? It was there and now it's not so it must be in my mouth! We do NOT need to be swallowing any more plastic!! I have a regular water pick and tooth brush combo but saw this and thought it would be GREAT travel with! Comes with a nice little bag to put it in which is nice because once you put water in it, unless you take it apart, there will be some water left in there. I squirt out as much as I can when I'm done but it's not totally cleaned out. That being said I think it's probably wise after a couple of months at least if not sooner you should maybe run some vinegar through it to clean it really well. I did that to start with to clean it before I used it.<br /><br />As for the settings.... I would like if there were more than 3 but for a travel one I'm OK with it only being 3. As another reviewer said, you DO need to make sure the light is lit on the setting you want to start off with. I'm used to using a water pick so I like it up pretty high but you may not! If you're new start low.<br />I can get through all of my teeth in my water tank but I have to go fast. If I've had some sticky stuff I may have to fill it back up again for a second go round. I saw some bigger ones but I like how this one is a little smaller. It does it's job.<br />I don't have a problem with cleaning mine after each go round. Someone mentioned cleaning it after each time. I just wipe it off with my hand towel. It's water that came out of my mouth. I have my own hand towel that no one else uses and it's my spit and I wash my hands afterwards so I don't feel it needs to be sanitized all the time. Maybe if you were sharing it but this is mine!<br /><br />I really like how you can charge it in any USB adapter. Super convenient these days.<br /><br />It comes with several pieces.

I’ve used it with Beauty Stat Moisture Boost Cream, but it also works great with other face creams. I even add it to my creams that fall just short of hydrating my skin enough and feel like the I get enough moisture once this squalane is added.<br /><br />I love the results of this squalane Essence as I notice it gives my skin an immediate moisture boost that minimizes my fine lines, and it also makes my dry skin feel silky soft. I’ve been using Beauty Stat squalane well over a month as this is my second bottle (finished a travel size first), and my skin looks and feels firmer too. Squalane is also anti aging as it has antioxidants that fight free radicals and skin damage. This Beauty Stat squalane is excellent for my dry, sensitive skin and squalane gets a low risk EWG rating.

It's just too much - kind of feels like a coating of Crisco on my skin.<br /><br />Also, the scent is odd. It doesn't smell like vanilla. It smells like... well, it's hard to explain.

I can't put my finger on what it was exactly just that I didn't really like it, but I can be picky over scents so that might just be me.

Reading the ingredients, I was impressed that the ingredients have detoxifying qualities. It really showed in the experience of how it was to use the salts.<br /><br />Though the instructions said to use the entire bag, I was a little shocked by this because it's a lot of salt and also at the time of purchase, the product was listed at about $35, so it seemed way too luxurious to use the entire thing. However, I tend to agree with them that half the bag was not quite enough and when the bath was full, I couldn't really smell the fragrance anymore with just half the bag.<br /><br />That said, even with just half the bag, I could feel the detoxifying qualities and after the bath I rinsed off well in the shower to remove any of the toxins that had come out through my skin.<br /><br />The sharp, rough rose quartz gem that was included was a bit of a surprise. I would've expected that in a product that you're supposed to dump out into your bathtub, they would've chosen a smoother stone rather than a rough one. It had some serious sharp angles to it. I would definitely recommend fishing it out before dumping the bag in your bath so that you don't scratch your bathtub. It is beautiful, though.<br /><br />Overall if the price to you seems fair for a single bath, then I highly recommend this product.

It’s also big enough for a long weekend away from home.<br /><br />This is a lightweight mineral oil based lotion that absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave any greasy residue. It has a pleasant feel and adds just enough moisture to make my dry hands soft and fairly comfortable. I do prefer more hydration, but I also have dry rather than normal skin. The fragrance is moderately strong and sweet. It’s okay used just on my hands, but it would be too strong for me if used as an all over body lotion.<br /><br />I dislike that this lotion has controversial Triethanolamine (TEA).

And TEA can play a role in the formation of dangerous nitrosamines when combined with certain preservatives. I can’t assess that issue in this or any specific products, so I just try to avoid TEA. That aside, I like this lotion pretty well for limited use. 3.5 Stars.<br /><br />Ingredients: Water, Mineral Oil, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Ethylhexanoate, Polysorbate 60, Sorbitan Stearate, Stearic Acid, Olea Europaea (Olive), Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Polyacrylate, Hydrogenated Polydecene, Trideceth-6, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Carbomer, Triethanolamine, Sodium Hyaluronate, Disodium EDTA, Allantoin, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Fragrance.",1

I can't deal with the whole false lashes thing, I don't do well with glues, and the magnetic ones don't seem to stay on well. When I tried this mascara I was hoping for fuller looking lashes and that's what I got! I do two coats and that does the trick for me. The brush is short so it's easier for me to apply as I seem to have more control, It's also a dense wand which seems to lift up and thicken my lashes without that super chunky look.(However, if the mood strikes for super chunky look, I'm sure I could achieve that with another coat of this mascara.)<br /><br />I've gotten to try a few bougie mascaras from Vine, some with high price tags, but none of them has worked as well as this one.

And I especially like how they have the little case with a mirror. That’s impossible to find. They work great and stay on my whole 12 hour shift. They are waterproof and you can’t scrub off with just water, not that a person would try. Cold cream works ok. But if you get some lash cleaner or makeup remover and apply to the end of a cotton swab and gently rub along lash, they practically fall off in seconds. At first, I was peeling them off because I thought since it’s magnetic that’s all that’s sticking. But then it’s hard to get the eyeliner off. After using a remover it’s much better. Don’t worry if you have trouble using liquid eyeliner. I promise after practicing a time or two, it will work perfect. If you get out of line, very quickly wipe off excess. It dries quickly. If it takes longer to put them on after applying liner, it will probably still work good.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,B08XZDXTG2,5,2021-05-07 09:12:51.291,Much more than just hyaluronic acid! Very moisturizing and best fitting for my face. 5 stars⭐,"I love these masks! For the price and how many you get, I was surprised to find the plastic backing. I really like this, because I can open it up and make a few cuts using the plastic and its cutouts as my guide to make it easier. I cut right through the plastic and the mask at the same time. I always have to cut a little slit at both the inner and outer corners of the eye openings, and also the outer corners of the mouth opening, as I like to move my mouth a bit and I have extremely dry eyes and the serum always gets into them, if I don't. This also lets it lay down flat on my nose and eyebrows better. I also cut four slits at about 10 and 2 o clock and 4:30 and 7:30, or roughly equal spacing coming upward diagonally from my eyes and coming down and outwards diagonally from the corners of my mouth. My face is a bit small, and this helps me to be able to overlap those areas and make them fit better, especially with larger masks. With these, I have to do the shallowest cutting ever, because they fit so well. They cover my entire face better than any mask I've used. I haven't had a problem with them lifting up or drying out at all. It also helps with something I will share later in my review.<br />It takes a little finagling, but I manage to squeeze a bit of the serum off the mask while removing it from the package. I start before I even open the package by pushing all the serum to the bottom. I cut the top open, grab the top of the Mask, and fold the sides of the package inward, almost in half, using my non-dominant hand. I start pulling out the mask while squeezing the top closed around it as best I can. This squeezes out a good bit of the way too much extra serum that comes out if I don't do this.<br />I love hyaluronic acid, but these masks have so many more wonderful ingredients than just that. Almost every ingredient is so nutrient-rich or moisturizing for the skin. I use Retin-A and these are the most soothing masks 1 to 2 days after my application nights, which are every 3 nights. These moisturize my face so well and they feel great while I have them on. I don't want to take them off when the timer goes off. There's plenty of serum in the package to use elsewhere, like on your neck & decollete, and even on your hands. I always put a moisturizer on afterwards to hold all the nutrients and moisture in properly.<br />I learned a trick while back from another reviewer that I've been doing since I read it. When taking a mask off my face, I cut it into 4 pieces. Mainly, I cut them apart at the forehead, cheeks, and chin areas, using the four diagonal cuts I made, but you can make the cuts as you wish. I usually discard the small pieces that cover the nose and upper lip. I then take those four pieces, put them back in the serum that's left in the package remoisten them, with these that is no problem, or just add a little hyaluronic acid serum to moisten them again, put them on my neck and decollete area the best I can, and wait another 15 or 20 minutes. This really lets me get the most possible use out of every mask.<br />I really love these masks and all of the skin loving ingredients they contain. They make my face feel wonderful afterwards and the effects last all day, if not longer. These are definitely on my must-have list. Highly recommend!",1

I'm not sure what is to be gained by its thickness (the teeth, after all, are normal) other than to exaggerate the fact that it's made of wood. I think it's made to be more of a display piece than a functional one, so if you have space to display it on a dresser table, it's certainly worthy of that. It has a nice design and comes across as well made. In the end, however, it's just a comb and while I appreciate its decorativeness, it's one of that space hogging pretty things that make sense only if you like displaying beautiful things.",1

AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,B08S3B8Y5G,5,2021-05-09 19:43:46.976,Comes with 8 scrunchies!,"This is definitely one of those products that I absolutely don’t need and didn’t know it existed, but now that I have one and know it exists, I love it and don’t want to let it go.<br />Honestly, this product is incredibly simple - it’s just a tube with a base, and even the base probably isn’t completely necessary.This particular holder comes with the tube and base connected and the open end of the tube facing down, so you’re unable to store anything inside of it unless you use it upside down, but then you couldn’t grab scrunchies off of it as easily. The strange thing about it is that the bottom of the base has some kind of brown paper on it - it looks like it should be removable, but it’s not. Honestly, since I’ll be keeping scrunchies on this pretty much all the time this will likely remain covered, but I still don’t like it. I would also like it better if the diameter of the tube was slightly smaller so some of my ties that are slightly smaller don’t get stretched out, but I can work with this. I’m very happy it fits perfectly on my bookcase where I wanted it to go, and I also really love that even though it’s only $10, it comes with eight scrunchies to get you started. I’ve been using one of these scrunchies all week and so far it’s holding up well - while I thought I wouldn’t like the material, it actually feels way nicer than it looks. I’m very happy with this product and am considering getting more as gifts for others later this year, if it holds up. I did get mine to use for scrunchies as the listing suggests, but you could also definitely use it for other things such as bracelets - it’s quite simple, but convenient.",1

Not Worth the Price for Me...","I tend not to like matte lipsticks because they always make my lips feel so dry. But, they last better than gloss. So, when I saw this and the claims of how long it lasted, I figured I’d try it! I was worried it would be more of a gimmick than anything, but hoped it would work to help me have lip color that lasts all day without the dryness!<br /><br />You have to be careful when putting it on to make sure you stay within your lips. If you get anywhere outside the lips, that area will be stained too. So, if you tend to do that a lot when applying lipstick, I definitely wouldn’t recommend this! It definitely takes a little longer than applying a regular lip product since you have to let it sit on your lips for at least 10-15 seconds before taking off the mask, longer if you want the color to be more intense. Whenever I left it on for only 10-15 seconds, the color was very, very faint. It gave my lips color, but not much. It said if you want more intense color to leave it on for 39-45 seconds, so I tried that the next time. It definitely gave my lips more color, but still not opaque color. So, the next time I left it on for almost a minute. Finally, I had opaque color. Having to leave it on for almost a minute can seem annoying, but I figured it’s worth it to have it last all day. It does last really well, way longer than any other lip product I’ve tried. But, when I eat or drink, it starts to fade a lot. So, if you’re not going to be eating or drinking much while wearing it, then it will last well for a long time. But, if you’re going to eat or drink a lot while wearing it, it definitely is going to fade.<br /><br />Overall, I think it’s a cool product. It’s definitely unique I think. But, for me, it’s pretty darn expensive. I’d rather just keep applying my lipstick or lip gloss throughout the day and only spend a few dollars on the product than have to apply it only once or twice but spend $32.50 on it. So, I’d say it’s up to you what is worth more to you. If you’re willing to pay $32.50 for your lip product to last all day on your lips and not have to keep reapplying it, then I’d recommend this. I will say remember if you’re eating or drinking a lot, you might feel the need to apply it again a second time after a while, but that’s still better than having to reapply it a ton like with most lip products. But, if like me, you’d rather spend less and just keep reapplying your lip product, then I wouldn’t recommend this for you.",0

There are plenty of face masks out there that are oversized or does not have the slits in the right place to fit the face form, but I could tell the fit would be perfect the moment I put them on.<br /><br />The face masks are soaked in hyaluronic acid and there was plenty left in the package after the face mask was removed, for me to squeeze additional gel onto my face. I left the face mask on for about 15 minutes. The area around my nose and cheeks still had plenty of moisture on it but the edges near the chin were dried up. The face mask seems to harden in the areas that are dried up.<br /><br />After the application, my skin did not absorb all the serum and it was still wet. I gently tapped around the area to get it evenly spread and dissolve. The skin felt moisturized. It wasn't sticky nor did it dry up my face. I am satisfied with the result and the product.",1

For myself personally, I have a couple of spots on my face, that tend to get drier than other areas. That results in dry patches of flaking skin. Needless to say, having those spots flaking, is not ideal. I wanted to try this particularly for its hydrating and moisturizing properties. I am pleased to report that this skin care product works extremely effectively. It has a very thick consistency to it, which to me indicates that it works well through its dense property. I use it after my shower in the evenings, and it totally alleviated the problems I had of any dry patches appearing on my face. I will say that it isn't in an inexpensive price range, but I'm happy with the results that I achieved when I used it. So if you can afford it, you might justify the expense. All in all it's an excellent cream, and I would certainly recommend it if you are like me, someone who suffers from dry skin and dry patches.",1

The good news is the manufacturer actually lists the ingredients on the box;  I've taken a photo of the box so you can see the ingredients - personally, I don't recommend using products where you can't see the ingredients before you order.<br /><br />The pencils you get are an interesting range, and seem to vary from package to package. Mine were in a variety of colors; the one color I was looking for - a basic nude - was not in my package - but I got a range of plums (which I never wear) and pinks (which I rarely wear).<br /><br />If you've used any of your mom's pencils, you're familiar with carmine, which can flake.

The metal doesn't bend and cleans easily with remover, followed by soap and water. The files haven't held up too well, however. Maybe I'm just a bit too rough on them, but I've worn through two of them already. I have spares on hand, but I wish they would have held up a bit better.

When I was in the shower and squirted some shampoo into my hand, I was amazed to see that the shampoo really is a dark purple color. I asked myself if I could live with it if it actually turned my hair purple, decided I could, and lathered up. The shampoo did an excellent job of creating a strong lather, and my hair felt really clean when I rinsed it out. The shampoo has a soft floral fragrance that is very pleasant. I took a quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was purple, and it wasn't, so I then squirted out some conditioner into my hand. It was purple, too, although thicker and lighter in color than the shampoo. As I rubbed the conditioner into my hair, the wonderful floral scent of the conditioner filled my shower--what a delightful sensory treat! I checked my hair again when I got out of the shower and dried off--still no purple hair, thank goodness. However, when I squirted some shampoo into my hand to take a photo, there was a big purple stain on my hand when I washed the shampoo off. I squirted the conditioner in a different spot on my hand for that photo, and it did the same thing. I've washed my hands several times since then, and the purple stains are still there. So...even though the product information online says it works fine with gray and white hair, I look down at my purple stains on my hand and I have to wonder. Since I love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and how incredibly soft it leaves my hair, I'm going to continue using it. If it turns my hair purple at some point in the future, I'll do an update and give everyone fair warning.",1

Initially I wanted to use this when I microneedle (machine, not roller) and as part of my aftercare for plasma fibroblasting.  And I loved the results.  So much so that I started using it with my other serums in my nightly skincare routine.  I've noticed increased hydration (or more accurately an increase in the retention of hydration) in my skin.  There's also been an increase in the firmness of the skin, which I can't say is down to this product alone.  I'm sure it's because I'm using it in conjunction with the microneedling and plasma treatments, but it's definitely adding to the overall outcome that I'm loving.  The research available on EGF is plentiful and something that makes sense to me as far as an anti-aging ingredient.  So much of the info surrounding ingredients is mostly hype and very little science or actual research.  EGF is one that is backed by research and EasyDew provides a GREAT formulation!!",1

This review is of: Got2B Glued 2in1 Spray Wax, translucent, 8 Ounce.<br /><br />Being that this is an entirely new product for me, it took me a few tries to get just the right amount to hold my hair back from frizzing and flying away, but I did find it. I like this better than hair spray because it doesn't make my hair crunchy while still keeping my style. I do sometimes have some flyaways near the end of the day, so I don't know if the hold fades or what exactly is happening, but 9 hours of hold is pretty good.

It is vaguely floral, definitely a feminine scent. It smells wonderful in the shower, but I like the fact that it fades quickly once you rinse it away. It doesn't linger all day, meaning it won't compete with any other fragrance you are wearing.<br /><br />Second, I like the fact that this set is gentle, and non-drying. (Some other brands have left me with straw-like hair after a few uses.) This combo cleans gently, and leaves the hair feeling silky.<br /><br />Third, the toning is effective. There is a visible difference after just a couple of uses. I saw the yellow/orange tones had faded after the first use, and after the second, my hair was shiny and showed highlights, but there was a marked difference in the amount of brassiness.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the fact that the shampoo is natural (made with botanicals) and is sulfate and paraben free. It is also cruelty free, another big plus. The pump bottles are also great, making the shampoo and conditioner easy to use in the shower. They are plastic, so no breakage issues.<br /><br />Finally, the price is right. The shampoo and conditioner bottles each contain 16.9 fl. oz of product. A good buy.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a solid 5 star set. Recommended!",1

Coconut, Lavender + Vanilla, Cucumber + Aloe and Shea + Cocoa Butter. Since it was very warm outside the day I ordered and with summer rapidly approaching, I chose Cucumber + Aloe.<br /><br />Perfect choice!<br /><br />This is a 2 pack of 24.5oz Hask Cucumber + Aloe Body wash. The scent is delicious- light , crisp and not at all overwhelming. The bottle's pump dispenses easily as well as a  good amount of body wash. It lathers quickly and does a great job of cleansing skin.  I also use it while shaving my legs and it works well.  When I step out of the bathtub my skin feels wonderful and I feel nice and relaxed.

It charges via usb which is great and convenient. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now, and I haven't had to charge it again. I probably use it for less than 2 minutes a day. My teeth do feel cleaner and I like the feeling of how the water targets in between the teeth.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it!",1

His skin isn't bad but everyone's skin could do with a little scrub every once in a while to brighten and freshen things up. I tested it out before giving it to him as i wanted to make sure these didn't have any off putting smells or texture. Scent wise, these are nice - not too overpowering, a gender neutral scent. I was expecting the typical masculine scent you find in men's skincare but I was pleasantly surprised that it is more gender neutral. After using the scrub my face felt clean. It isn't a super strong, gritty scrub but more on the gentler side. I think this could be a good scrub to use 3 times a week because it isn't super gritty but I would also rotate this with another face scrub that is grittier. This scrub didn't leave my skin with the softest, smoothest feeling afterwards like with some other scrubs but it isn't bad. This is a good one for someone that wants a gentler, less harsh scrub.

My skin isn't dried out and feels generally better than where I was using normal soap. And I like how you don't really need to use much of this to get it all over your face.<br />The scent was a bit of a let down because it's sort of nice but a bit weak.

I usually read or watch something on my tablet while I’m wearing it which means I have my glasses on. I am so pleased that they sit well on my nose and don’t interfere with the action of the mask in any way.

I will say I have oily eyelids and noticed that they don't last more than a couple hours.<br />I think these would make a great gift for adults, teens, or even younger kids who want play makeup. My daughters who are 6 and 7 found them one day and loved using them. They especially loved the blue and purple that they said made them look like a mermaid.  They are super fun and priced fairly so I would say give them a try!",1

NOT salon results.  i have super natural curly hair - i can still wash my hair curly.  the same amount of curls as i have always had.  when i do wear it curly though, i also still have the same amount of frizz.  it's sad and true.  that said though - it's when wear it straight that the product shows it's worth!  the picture i have posted it right after coming after getting caught in the rain.  in the past my hair would just revert back to the full on curl, no waves just the game of 'how big is my hair gonna grow?' watch party.  this time though ... i ended up with a style that i actually like!  something i could easily still get away with wearing for the rest of the day/evening.  as rainy and muggy as it has been lately - i can dig this and appreciate it through and through.<br /><br />so all that said - do i wish it did a bit more for the curly hair frizz ... yes.  but for the price and the fact that i will probably get 4 treatments out of this set - i think the system is worth for the investment - cost and time.",1

I am not kidding when I say that I rinsed my hair 3 separate times and still found my hair/scalp purple. I don't have a mirror in my shower so I just kept rinsing out leaning over the tub. Finally after the third time, I said forget this and got back in the shower and washed my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner. I still fee like there is a tiny bit in areas and my whiter blonde has a little purple tint. It was also very dry feeling after the three rinses. My hair felt like straw.<br />I am not sure if the scalp dying was because I used a shampoo brush and didn't have it immediately rinsed  out as I was putting on a face mask. I had accidentally went to put in the conditioner and realized after I put it on the top of my scalp that it was the shampoo and waited till my face mask was done drying a few minutes later to rinse out.<br />It really was drying even after I used my regular sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner and put in my super moisturizing leave-in conditioner. I might try it again if I have a color that turns out horribly and I need to tone it down. I was just surprised it how much it toned it down and my darker blonde now looks too dark/dull, unless it is still got some purple in it.<br />So if you use it, I probably would not use a shampoo brush and I would not leave it in at all. Not even the conditioner which says to leave in a few minutes.",0

So, they are easy to use and lush and last with a few uses at least. They are good value for the money and look pretty on any eye. I decided I'm not an eyelash person as I wear glasses and they always seem to drive me crazy hit the glass. But, overall these is a great set if you are interested in fake lashes.",1

You rub the stick on your dry face, then use water. It's different but very easy to get used to quickly.<br /><br />The soap doesn't lather all that much but it does do a good job of cleaning without drying out my face. The scent is quite nice, with the eucalyptus coming through the most. It's a medium/mild level of scent that is noticeable without being overwhelming. The scent does not linger after rinsing. The soap itself is black due to the inclusion of charcoal.<br /><br />The dispensing tube is well done, with a screw base that pushes up the soap easily and evenly. It also has a screw top cover, which is a nice touch for keeping the lid affixed if you take this while traveling or use it in a gym bag.<br /><br />It's an unusual but enjoyable twist on face soap. A bit pricey for the amount you get, but it's sufficiently unique to justify the cost, in my opinion. Five stars.",1

It has a wonderful, clean aroma, and does not feel like a peel or any other face mask. For those who are using for first time, a word of caution. The mask will slide all over the place after you open it, so slowly open the package holding it up or sideways so that it is flat. Be careful not to drop it! Also be patient and place it on one section of your face at a time. It will fit every area of your face, and you can adjust it to your face shape and size.

Amazing,"I dont quite get the concept of 'beard balm' or even beard oil.  But I have been hearing a lot about oud wood oil and its scent.  WOW I would describe it as soft and warm.  Sort of a nice leather jacket that has been around a little pipe smoke.  Its a scent that you notice only when near someone.  Its not a scent that broadcasts itself to a whole room like a teenager cologne.<br /><br />Looks like they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.<br />So trust me, buy one of the oud products they have available, maybe just the $15 bottle.  If you arent keen on it then you just contact the seller.<br />I doubt that will happen though.  As soon as you smell it you will probably go ahead and buy the larger bottle, or maybe by then the cologne will be out.<br />Thats what happened to me.  As soon as I bought the beard balm I quickly grabbed the beard oils.  I wont be putting it in my beard but I have been mixing it into unscented hand lotion and putting it all over.<br />I wish I had adequate words to describe the scent.",1

I just bought a Cuisinart Ice Cream Machine and followed a simple recipe for chocolate ice cream, but I wanted to make sure that it would not become hard and full of ice crystals once I stored it in the freezer, so I did some research online and glycerin is one of several ways to keep ice cream creamy.  It only takes a teaspoon in the recipe and the other thing about glycerin is that it is sweet, so it blends in well with an ice cream recipe.  My ice cream turned out great and it is smooth and creamy after being in the freezer.  Now, this is not my first use of glycerin as I have used a small amount in water to spray in my hair.  Especially on really humid days when my naturally curly hair turns into a frizz-ball, spraying my hair with a 10 parts water, 1 part glycerin (or even less glycerin, depending) keeps my hair from frizzing out so bad.

It hits the right middle ground: not so coarse that you feel as if you're rubbing gravel on your face, but not so fine that there's no scrub action.

Not much is needed per use.<br /><br />The scent is fairly mild and while you can pick out the eucalyptus scent it's not so strong to be overwhelming, as eucalyptus can sometimes get.

This is convenient for adding to gift baskets or as stocking stuffers. I like the generous size of each tube of lotion. The lotion is moisturizing, but not too greasy. This is a high quality lotion that actually softens hands and combats dryness. I like the pleasant scent of this Green Tea hand lotion. The scent is light and fresh, but not too sweet nor strong.",1

In the attached photo you can see the grit contained in the scrub.  The directions say to use a amount equal to a penny and my experience says that's enough to do a good job of exfoliating facial skin.  The scent to me seemed like a burnt avocado, not particularly pleasant but I'm not using it for the scent and the scent rinses off.  I deducted one-star for the price which seems a bit steep to me.  My regular scrub costs significantly less and exfoliates as well if not a bit better.  Good to try, good as a gift but I probably wouldn't buy again.",1

It's a medium consistency that dispenses easily. The pump mechanism works well to output just a small amount at a time which is a plus since not much is needed per use. It lathers readily and does an excellent job of cleaning. My face feels tight after using it but in a good way -- a clean tightness rather than a dried out tightness.<br /><br />The scent is excellent. It's a woodsy type of scent that is different and very enjoyable. The scent does not linger after use (which is a shame since it is such a nice smell).<br /><br />It's pricey per ounce, but considering how little is needed for good results, the cost per use is not bad at all. Plus the scent is so unique that, for me, it's worth the extra amount. Five stars!",1

These patches didnt irritate my skin at all like other patches i have tried which burned my skin. My skin is sensitive and these patches no matter how much i put on didnt irritate my skin. However, it did pull abit of my peach fuzz (facial hair) so that is something to be mindful about. It is my go to pimple spot patch because i really see that it works. Also, another benefit is that once the pimple is empty and you remove the sticker to let it heal on its own, no blemish (dark spot) is left over except a tiny scab that falls off after a few days.",1

You just add some distilled water or purified water and turn the steamer on. Since the steam is hot, you need to make sure that your face is away enough from the nozzle. I like how the steam comes from in a direction that covers the chin and the face. There is no option for adjusting the level of the mist but I do not think if it is necessary since the amount of steam is good in this device. There is a manual inside the package that I found really helpful. The water tank is small and for me, the tank size is holding the exact amount of water I need for each usage.<br /><br />The steamer can be used for hydrating the skin. It also opens the pores and is good for deep cleaning. But the thing I really enjoy while using this steamer is that it is very helpful for my Sinusitis. The warm mist soothes and moisturizes my sinus passageway. So, for me, it does not only make my skin hydrated but also unblocking my sinuses.<br /><br />I also like the portable facial steamer. It is chargeable which is great. It is not that much powerful and it is releasing cold mist but, it is a good size for travel. Surprisingly, this tiny humidifier works for about 10-15 minutes. The other things in the package are also useful to have a nice Spa at home.<br /><br />All in all, I like the whole set and to me, each part of this package is useful and works great.",1

I love the look and style of the lashes I think they are like a soft glam look and not too overly dramatic. The lash band is lined with magnetic pieces which you can see if looked at closely not while wearing but prior to application. The magnetic eyeliner applicator is also something I truly like as it is a felt tip which isn't bendy or floppy. Its not so stiff you can't work with it but its not flimsy as in it would be hard to apply or even get a nice sharp wing with it. The one issue I do have with the magnetic eyeliner is it almost comes across as a glue adhesive and when I say that I don't mean like with glue you can reapply as much as you need to even if you mess up with this formula one coat and you can't go back over it because it will not only pick up pieces of the other product and it also doesn't layer well. However what I do mean is that if you apply the lashes and say you its not sticking to your inner corner and you have to remove some if not alot of the adhesive is def coming with it dry or not. Outside of the above mentioned problem I just had issues with it sticking to my inner corner but the lashes look absolutely beautiful on and I def love the style that's for sure. Its one of those things where I am not used to magnetic lashes and this is my first time trying them so its something I'm going to have to get used to. I will also say the adhesive was pretty easy to remove in which I used something similar to a makeup eraser. The only issues I had were the bits that stuck im my own lashes that I had to physically remove with my hands.,1

That said, this product is my favorite from BeautyStat. This is one I would be repurchasing once I am done with this bottle. I loved how it felt on my skin, and although it is a ""face oil"", did not leave my skin a greasy mess. My skin soaked it up soon after applying and just made it feel nice and moist. It just feels very light and will not feel like it is ""weighing"" down your skin like some heavy oils can do. It feels very gentle and I did not experience any itchiness or irritation. There is no scent to this, and is just 100% pure Squalane. If you are wanting to try this brand but not sure which product to get first, I would say get THIS.",1

Cons:  the masks are folded with a backing sheet but are still trickier than most to unfold; the eye holes are a little small; and my skin feels sticky after I remove the masks and pat in the remaining serum, so I have to splash cool water to get my skin feeling clean.

My husband also said he really liked it, so that's a win! The only thing I don't love about it is the cheap looking plastic lid on the bottle. It really cheapens the look of the bottle and doesn't snap on well, which is kind of a pain. I thought about just throwing it away, but then if I travel with the bottle I'm afraid it will spray all over my bag.

Although the box is in English, and has clear instructions and ingredients, the product itself lacks those things. Celimax comes in a streamlined bottle that looks like mineral water. Aside from the general disaster that could pose with small children, the FDA requires cosmetic products sold in the USA list their ingredients on the bottle in English.<br /><br />The ingredients, by the way, which I wish Amazon would leave a spot for cosmetic vendors to include in their listings, so we would know before we order in case of allergies, are Sedum Sarmentosum, Butylene Glycol, Water, 1,2-Hexanediol, Glycerin, Glycereth-26, Polyglutamic Acid, Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid, Ceramide NP, Xylityglucoside, Anhydroxylitol, Xylitol, Dipotassium Glycrrhizate, Citrus Tangerina Peel Oil, Pelargonium Graveolens Flower Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia Oil, Glucose, Phospholifpids, Diethoxyethyl Succinate, Caprylic/Capric Triclyceride, Ammonium Acryloylidimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Hydrogenated Lecithin, C12-13 Pareth-9, Disodium EDTA, Chlorphenesin.<br /><br />Having said that, I poured a little bit of the product onto a cotton pad in the evening and dabbed it onto my face, and onto the back of my hands. It initially felt just  a bit tacky, but almost immediately absorbed. I followed up on my face with my nightly cream. My face this morning feels AMAZING. The moisture level is through the roof.<br /><br />I also want to mention fragrance. Like 95% of chronic migraine headache sufferers, I have a sensitive sense of smell. Anything cosmetic that has perfume (think lip smackers) or added scent has the potential to make me nauseous and bring on a migraine. This had just a faint authentic citrus smell, vaguely pleasant, which thankfully disappeared within a few seconds of hitting the cotton ball. That kind of fragrance is ideal.<br /><br />And the effects are just amazing. I don't see my face all day, but I can sure see my hands on the keyboard. My hands are visibly more plumper, less dry, and  more hydrated. I am loving this product. Hopefully they're in process with getting their bottle properly labelled and safe for distribution in the United States, because this is my new routine. Such results!",1

As someone with chronically dry, sometimes dehydrated skin I thought this toner could help me.  ""Sedum is a succulent leaf known for its intense hydration, vitamins & mineral level.  It holds more hydration than watermelon and is rich in phytoestrogen that further boosts hydration and improves the skin condition.""  When I read that, I thought this sounded like the recipe for perfect skin, but every time I use this essence my face turns super oily.  I have never experienced this kind of change from any of the hydrating essences I own.<br /><br />The scent on this is light, clean, and fresh, very herbal.  You should be aware that this product is fragranced with natural fruit oils & extracts.  A few minutes after application though, the scent dissipates quickly.  My skin is crazy reactive & very sensitive, but I did not experience any adverse reactions to the ingredients used in this essence.<br /><br />There was also a generous amount of samples from Celimax included with this toner.  😀  They sent 2 Noni ampoules, 3 serum packettes, and 2 AHA/BHA exfoliating/brightening pads (labeled for underarms, but can be used elsewhere).  Korean brands are so very gracious with samples!  Thank you, Celimax! ❤<br /><br />Both the package & bottle both come safety sealed.  The bottle is of nice size (150ml) and features a shaker style spout for easy dispensing.  I pour a small amount of the essence into my hands, then pat into the skin after cleansing. Then I apply my serums & moisturizer.<br /><br />Though I don't find this product to be a particularly good fit for my skin right now (during the hot & humid Florida summer heat, when my oil production is already at it's peak), I think this essence may work better for me in the winter.  I do think it's a nice product, so it still gets a 4 star rating from me.",1

It is essentially a circular deodorant stick for your face. Just rub it on until your face is covered then wet your hands and massage the product into your face which will foam up. I usually like to massage the cleanser into my face for about 20-30 seconds before rinsing my face. My face feels nice and clean after using this.

It’s to be used 1-2x weekly and after you use their facial cleansing stick. While the cleanser cleans your face, the scrub exfoliates and removes dead skin and gunk out of your face, leaving you with a refreshing and hydrated feeling. I personally use it once a week after cleansing followed by the face mask that disco provides. I put a smudge on both sides of my cheeks and my forehead and slowly but gently rub it in. This particular product hurts a bit if you rub it in hard in my experience so I go nice and easy on my face while rubbing it in to stop any irritation from occurring. After about 30 seconds I rinse my face off with water and dry it with a dry and clean towel. The product works great in removing gunk from your face and will leave you feeling nice and fresh!",1

After that, I just dry my face again and use disco’s facial moisturizer!

I has really good lather, a strong pump and a wonderful scent. It lathers easily and also rinses out easily. I like how my hair feels after using it. I am not so much of a fan of the conditioner. I was a bit surprised that after putting it in my hair, my hair did not feel slick like it does with most conditioners. It actually felt quite coarse. I always brush my hair while in the shower with the conditioner still in it. I attempted that with this conditioner and found that not only did the conditioner not do any untangling, but I got the brush stuck in my hair! I then rinsed and rinsed to get it all out and then tackled the knotted hair. My hair acted as if I had not had any conditioner at all and I had to fight my way through the knots.

I get good results from the hyaluronic acid (HA) serum as it gives quick but temporary plumping and smoothing of wrinkles, as do other good HA serums. I also suspect the warmth created by Nira laser may increase absorption of the HA serum and boost its short term benefits (though I can’t say for sure).<br /><br />I assume it will take regular use for at least 60 days (and likely 90 days) to judge Nira‘s benefits beyond the temporary HA plumping. Nira’s own before and after photos are from the 90-day mark. While I’ll continue use of the Nira laser to see if it helps, I question the extent of any long term benefits based on Nira’s own photos that show a smiling before photo and a rather solemn after photo; clearly, we more lines are evident when smiling so I feel photos would be more credible if they showed someone with the same or similar expression in the before and after photos.<br /><br />Still, I like the Nira laser as it holds a charge well and is quick and easy to use. It gives feedback via beeps. Nira states it has FDA clearance (which I haven’t verified) for wrinkle treatment around the eyes. I’m cautious about the eye area, so I’m initially trying Nira on less sensitive skin between my eyebrows where I have fine lines and slight sagging and also on my neck where I have a weird wrinkle likely from looking down at my tablet. I started using Nira on fine lines around my mouth, but I may hold off until I feel confident it won’t exacerbate existing pigmentation issues.<br /><br />Nira is painless and I only feel warming on setting 2 or 3 (depending on area). The skin around my mouth is drier and only tolerates a 2, and it turns red temporarily. I’ve tried a 4 between the eyebrows and it stings, so I’ll need to work up. I use the HA serum after use, and it’s a clear gel like serum that’s calming and my redness goes away quickly. I get a quick plumping effect that temporarily helps smooths lines, but I can’t say if Nira will provide a long term benefit over time. I do like using it with the serum, so I’m rating it 4 stars. I’ll update as appropriate.",1

This one I really didnt think was bad though.  It's super easy to put together and use. You do have to change it before use, and the. Harge port is at the bottom of the white power unit, between the u it and the blue water tank, kind of odd placement, but no biggie. It holds a charge really well. It has 3 different settings, pulse ( which I dont like) soft and normal. I prefer the soft because my gums are sensitive. You have ton pool ut it in your mouth before turning on, it sprays out alot of water, so you have to turn the power off to spit,  and power back on to continue, that would be my biggest complaint. But really is no biggie. For being under 40 dollars, I cant day much I think it's easy to use,  works well, its helping for what I need, and if I stay consistent with it, maybe I'll upgrade to a bigger one. Also, I love the size, it's very compact compared to other units.",1

I adjusted one of them and it looked very lopsided on my head as a result of the adjustment.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are not my favorite caps. They are too big and the adjustment throws the elastic out of whack. The current price of $11.99 comes to $4 per cap.",0

I applied it to my wet hair and worked it in. Loved the purple lather. Then applied the conditioner which is more of a deep inky blue.  The instructions said to leave it in for a few minutes. When I wash it out, my hair feels differently--it feels as though there's still something there on my hair, but deeply mixed in. It feels differently than when I use regular shampoo.<br />Anyway, I love what this does for my hair. It seems to brighten the light silver and darken the darker grey. At least that's what it seems like. No frizzies either and that's important for me.<br />I used Great Clips brand before trying this, and while I really liked what Great Clips Purple shampoo did for my hair, I prefer this brand.

I was excited to try their other products so this was a great kit for that without having to purchase the full size of each product. This came in a beautiful cardboard box, fancier than most trial kits.<br /><br />There are four products to try:<br />- restoring serum<br />- activating exfoliator<br />- softening hydra-wrap<br />- eye rejuvenating elixir<br /><br />My favorite is the hydra wrap and exfoliator.<br />The hydra wrap is quite moisturizing and rich without feeling heavy, nor did it feel sticky/tacky after applying. I could slightly feel it on my skin after applying but it wasn't greasy or uncomfortable. The exfoliator has little shea nut powder beads in it to help exfoliate and scrub, and has a thick consistency. It is like your typical face exfoliator except it has great, good for your skin, quality ingredients.<br /><br />The eye elixir is good and felt like a gentler/less rich moisturizer compared to the face cream.<br /><br />I didn't like the serum because of the consistency - it is too liquid-y for me, and is almost like a toner than your typical serum. It felt fine on the face but I just didn't like how runny it was. The dropper style dispenser is great but it was like dispensing toner.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed AAVRANI's product line. I'm actually surprised at the quality of the packaging for a trial set like this. It is just as luxurious as the full sized products. I feel bad that I'll just be discarding the bottle/packaging after use. AAVRANI products products smell nice (some are even fragrance free as I didn't smell any fragrance) and nothing felt sticky/tacky or uncomfortable on my skin. I have been loving a lot of these ayurvedic based skincare brands as they seem to use better, cleaner, and gentler ingredients. If you are looking for something like that, do give AAVRANI a try - it is good stuff. I am saving this set to bring with me on weekend getaways.",1

However, for a body that's been in the sun and/or water, this lotion is absolutely perfect and quite effective. It's a bit thin as I said, but it absorbs quickly and seems to last for at least 3-4 hours.

It makes me feel like I am living as a tudor or in elizabethan or renaissance times or something.  Would actually look great wearing to a Renaissance Faire.<br /><br />The problem is that the thing is not made in the best way.  First, when it arrived, it had already lost a stone – although it was floating around inside the plastic bag.  Try as I might, I can not get it to reattach as I think the prongs are now broken.  I will try instead to glue it back in.  Makes me wonder how long it will take for the other stones to also fall out…  Usually with jewelry, it is preferable to have prong set stones but apparently not in a headband as all those prongs grab and catch like every hair available on your head.  It pulled so much of my hair out when I tried simply removing it from my head.  (My pictures of the hair caught was AFTER I pulled most of the hair off the prongs.  It was easily 4 to 6 times as much stuck on it originally.)<br /><br />Because of the issue stated above I can only recommend for like one time use – knowing you are going to lose a bunch of hair because of it.  Otherwise I can not recommend. : (  Maybe if you have VERY short hair that has no way of catching…  (It also came with a freebie hair clip which I will give to a child and a sweet, cute paper origami heart - love that!)<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

It's a good size bottle that will probably will probably last me 9-10 months. The packaging is attractive and highly simple and modern. There's almost no scent to the essence, maybe a very faint scent of citrus if I were to pinpoint, which is ideal for people who have sensitive nose.<br /><br />I am not a chemist so the ingredients described have no meaning to me. Though, the essence contains hyaluronic acid which is the main ingredient in the toner that I use for final stage of my daily facial cleaning process. The toner is a lot thicker in content and leaves my skin sticky whereas this essence is very water based and feels amazing after applying. My skin reacted and absorbed the essence right away and left my skin smooth and moisturized without feeling any stickiness. Even my hands got moisturized and I do not have to wipe or wash away after the application. I learned through reading the product description that this essence contains low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which with its small molecular structure makes it easier for it to absorb into the skin.

I looooove that scrub. It smells AMAZING and the smell stays with you. You know how most body scrubs smell nice but as soon as you’re done using it, you can’t really smell it on you? Well, the Bum Bum Body Scrub isn’t like that! You can smell it on you after, heck, my whole apartment smells like coconut after using it! BUUUUT it’s $42 and it’s a sugar scrub so it goes FAST. I also hate the container it comes in. It’s cute, but it’s a pain to open in the shower, get your hand in there and get some scrub out, and it dissolves pretty quick as water hits it since it’s a sugar scrub. So, I wanted a sugar scrub that was more affordable, but still smelled great, that wasn’t such a pain to get out in the shower, and that possibly didn’t dissolve so quick when water hit it. THIS SCRUB CHECKS ALL THOSE BOXES!<br /><br />It’s way more affordable than the Bum Bum scrub. It comes in a jar, so you have to screw the top off, similar to the Bum Bum scrub. But, a lot easier. It smells amazing, like vanilla. It isn’t as strong smelling as the Bum Bum scrub, but I still feel like I can smell it on me after my shower. The BEST part....this is a “Sugar Balm Body Scrub.” The balm makes it kind of like a thicker, kind of paste. It is easier to pick up with your hands, spread on your body, and it doesn’t dissolve anywhere close to as quick as most sugar scrubs.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE this scrub! I will definitely replace it when I run out, and definitely recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE - The first few times I used this, I don’t know how I didn’t notice. But, when I was using it again, I saw a loose hair from my head on my arm, I went to pick it up and as I did, my nails kind of scraped against my skin. I felt gunk go under my nails. I looked and saw all this gunk under the 2 nails that scraped against my skin! I was like, “WHAT THE HECK?!” So, then I took my nails and scraped against another area I’d used the scrub at and the same thing happened. I remembered people saying this left a film on their skin, which at the time I initially wrote my review I didn’t feel it did. But, now I DEFINITELY say it does. BUT, it can be washed off. After I scraped my skin and found out about the gunk, I took a regular body wash on a wash cloth and went over the areas I’d used the scrub. After that I scraped my nails over the areas again and, thankfully, no gunk. So, you can get the residue off. Now, whether or not you want to go through scrubbing your body with this scrub and then go over it again with soap or body wash, that’s up to you. For me, it’s not a big deal because I like how this is a balm that doesn’t rinse away as quickly as a regular sugar scrub does. I like that I can spread it onto my body and then scrub without worrying about it melting away as soon as it touches my skin. So, I’m okay dealing with having to go over the areas with a body wash after using it. But, I’m definitely going to keep searching to find the perfect body sugar scrub that is affordable and doesn’t melt away quickly like this one, but that doesn’t leave a film I have to wash off after using it. So, I’m dropping my rating down from a 5 to a 3. I thought about only dropping it to a 4 since I still like it and am willing to deal with having to go over and wash again where I used it. But, it is still kind of a pain to have to do, so I decided to drop it to a 3.",0

I had been using the green discs for moderate abrasion because I didn't want to harm my skin, but, because I don't have sensitive skin, I soon moved up to the very coarse red discs. What a difference they made! I love them, and they didn't irritate my skin at all. (If you're just beginning microdermabrasion, however, I would advise beginning with something delicate or moderate to see how your skin reacts.)<br /><br />Like some of the other reviewers, I thought the moderate discs were doing a good job, and they were, but the red are vastly superior. They remove many more dead and dull skin cells, and, additionally, I use them on my arms and legs as well. My skin does feel a little sensitive after I use these, and I would greatly advise investing in the cleanser, toner, and recovery cream especially made for use with this device. (Skin is less sensitive than it is after dermaneedling, however.) I usually use this device in the evening, and the next day, i go lighter on my skin care routine, still using the PMD products and of course, sunscreen. Your skin will be more vulnerable after one of these treatments, even if you don't feel any stinging at all. Go easy on any products containing acid, especially glycolic, which can make you far more susceptible to sun damage. I do use a glycolic toner in the morning, and a glycolic resurfacing cream at night, but I wait about two nights after using this device to do so.<br /><br />This device, and these discs, have really improved my skin. I have no discoloration, no visible pores, no superficial lines or wrinkles. This device has helped me develop the coveted ""glass skin"" face. My arms have lost the ""sun freckles"" I developed a few years ago, due to lack of sunscreen (won't make that mistake again) and they, too are very smooth. None of those little bumps some of us can develop. Just arms as smooth as silk.<br /><br />This is the only home microdermabrasion device I've found that can equal a salon treatment. It's so easy to use, and it's so convenient. It's always ready for me, anytime I want to use it. No scheduling appointments, no drive to the spa, then another drive back home. I can pamper myself right in my own brand new bathroom, which was designed to contain a mini-spa. I love it! I really love the fresh, radiant, glowing skin this device gives me. But, you do have to use it twice a month to keep the glow. Believe me, the few minutes it takes to use this are certainly worth it. (Keep the device moving, don't hold it in one place.)<br /><br />I use this device twice a month, and will continue to do so. And, I may buy the discs that are made especially for the body to use on my arms and legs. In fact, I know I will.<br /><br />I've never been disappointed by a PMD device or product yet, and I don't believe I ever will be.",1

This Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener, however, is in a class all by itself. Even the box it comes in is beautiful, with soft sweeping white and beige brush strokes in the background and beautiful flowers embossed in gold. The pattern wraps all the way around the box, with each side being different. The inside of the box is a vivid lime green. The spray bottle for the air freshener looks more like a perfume bottle, light and dark pink with more of the gold embossing, this time with leaves instead of flowers. The key ingredients of this air freshener are water, hibiscus oil, and hydrogenated castor oil. The bottle contains 3.38 fl oz (100 ml). The directions say to wash linens and clothes before spraying this linen mist on them. It says this spray can be used on sheets, furniture fabric, drapes, pillows, and directly in the room as an air freshener. It also says to shake the bottle well before using it. When sprayed, the hibiscus scent is very subtle and faint, but definitely there. My wife had me spray some on the blouse she was wearing so that she could enjoy the hibiscus scent all day long, and she plans to spray her pillow before she goes to sleep. For a soft, gentle hibiscus aroma that stays pleasantly in the background without overwhelming my senses, this Florona Hibiscus Air Freshener works well.",1

Quality craftsmanship.,"The aventurine/jade in the massage roller and gua sha differ in terms of coloration. However, it does not detract from the overall quality and attractiveness of the set. The presentation further lifts the value as a gifting option.<br />The gua sha has a nice thickness, and has a good degree of polishing. This creates a shiny and very smooth surface. The contour has smooth rounding, with clean lines. Inspection of the heart shaped gua sha found no defects or flaws. Happily, there are not scratches or nicks to be found on the aventurine gua sha.<br />The massage roller has features associated with premium level products. It has the metal collar/ring on the metal axle/arm where it meets the stone roller. This is a nice aesthetic touch.<br />An important aspect, which isn't a cosmetic affect, is the plastic grommet that acts as a bearing between the metal arm/axle and the stone rollers. This plastic piece facilitates a quiet and smooth rolling action; without this grommet, there's a good possibility of noticeable squeaking and a 'rough' rolling motion. Of equal import, the grommet protects the aventurine and the metal arm from direct contact, and avoids erosion of both parts.<br />The set matches the description and images in the product details. I appreciate that the company is upfront about the stone being aventurine (it is often called Autralian or Indian Jade, due to the appearance, but is actually part of the quartz family). Many companies use the jade classification to enhance the credentials of the product. It's not deceptive or misleading. Anyway, glad to see the company provide an honest account of the materials.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Based on the quality and initial impressions, this massage roller and gua sha set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1

I used it three times so far for different gels like Poly gel, gel polish and builder gel and it worked for all of them. Compare to other same product the price is so reasonable for a couple of reasons. First, the power is so high because I used to keep my fingers under UV for 2 minuets with other LED lams but this one just needs 90 seconds. The longer you keep your fingers under UV the more your skin get darker and also is not good for your health. The main purpose that I got this UV lamp was my pregnancy which I really did not want to go to the salons because I think the smell of so many chemicals in the salons is not good for my baby health. The quality of the lamp is not so good. Once it fell off on the carpet and it became a little bit loos however it is still working.<br />To put everything in a nutshell it is a good purchase if you are not a nail artist and you do not want to use it in your profession.<br />Pros:<br />1. High power<br />2. Good price<br />Cons:<br />1. Low body quality",0
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,B093PLB98K,2,2021-06-28 02:58:29.910,Not the best DIY lash extension kit..,"I had high hopes for this diy lash extension kit.. but just was a huge mess and lashes tore too easily. First off, when you take the lid off the lash glue - it has a tip which would’ve been helpful for getting the glue out but you absolutely cannot squeeze the bottle.. like I tried for a good 5 mins. The bottle isn’t squeezable. So I held it upside down to get the glue to come out.. well it took forever for one drop to come out. So I took the lash tweezers this kit comes with and took the tip off and poured the glue on a old empty metal makeup tray. But what I didn’t expect was for the glue to be so runny - pouring it out was a huge mess and got on my shirt and some other things that are now stained and ruined. Secondly, the glue is black.. I would’ve preferred a clear glue with these. Just because if you mess up on the placement and get a smudge of glue on your eyelid - or anywhere - it’s a pain to get off. And you just have this black smudge until you do. It’s also stingy which is frustrating. They offered various sizes in the kit but they’re so fragile and tear too easily. I lost several clusters because when I picked them up from the tray (using the lash tool they provided) - they’d tear. I got to angry to keep going so I can’t attest to how long they’ll last. But I’m just no impressed.",0

The roller is composed of quality materials and manufacture. While they give instructions for cooling therapy, by placing it in the fridge, it can also be used for warming application. I use a heating pad or heated gel pack to envelop the massage tool (specifically the rollers). This warms the metal roller sufficiently to afford a warming massage.<br />The one minor issue is the brand name emblazoned on the handle. I would have preferred a solid purple coloring on the handle. This is shown in the pictures in the product details, so this issue won't affect the rating. However, I do feel it's too large, conspicuous on the handle.<br />The significant other still uses this with the rollers at ambient temperature or cooled. However, she does like it when I warm the rollers and apply a massage to the back and sides of the neck.<br />Overall, this metal facial massage roller is exactly as shown and described in the product details. It's well made, durable and attractive. It meets expectations, earning a 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",1

Well, it's different, interesting, with a subtle but deep aroma, that actually is quite nice.  I spritzed some mist on our bedding about an hour before bedtime, and later the slight delicate fragrance was there in a relaxing sort of way.  Not powerful or too flowery for the guys, but a nice calm fresh and peaceful scent that was only minimally noticeable.  The spray has only 3 ingredients listed: water, hibiscus oil, castor oil, - no chemicals, so looks to be pretty pure, and it comes in a clear plastic bottle with plastic pump.

It has a very nice floral aroma and I tried it in 2 ways. As a room spray it's just ok. I say that because the scent just doesn't last long. As a linen spray it's better. It seems to last longer that way and would be nice at bedtime to spray a little on sheets or pillow cases. I can't comment on the value since there is no price listed on the product page.

It does a wonderful job massaging in serums and whatnot to promote better absorption as well.<br /><br />If I'm being nit-picky, the only problem I would have is that due to the angled rollers, going one way vs the other feels different and if you don't rotate the roller, it will give you an uneven massaging experience.<br />Also, the price point probably would be an issue as you can potentially get a lesser quality roller for way cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, quite happy with it.",1

Fits my large head, and all my hair","An adorable shower cap that fits my large head. It says it fits up to 24"" head, and mine measures 23.5"". Then I have loads of hair- semi thick, nearly waist length. It all fits! Yet isn't a big bulbous excess of material either. But I am definitely pushing max space available (again, I have a large head).<br /><br />I simply dont wash my hair every day, but I do hop in the shower. I dont notice my hair getting wet at all, but I dont put my head in the water even with this on. I have a spray nozzle for washing and rinsing, so I guess I am able to control where the water reaches better.<br /><br />The fit is surprisingly good. The rear has an elastic portion to provide a nice fit. The spacing left over once in place is reasonable for my large head and mane of hair. I really was skeptical, but am glad I went ahead and got this. I have some cute shower caps, but none as nice as this. The little bow on top makes me feel like I went back in time to the 50s or something. Adorbs!<br /><br />I dont use it for keeping my hair out of face for make up or skin care, but it would certainly do well for that too. Also, if I had pool.. while it isnt a pool cap, if I just wanted something to help keep excess water off my hair while casually wading in a pool, this very well could work for that too.",1

The formula advertises to be sweat proof/waterproof, but that is definitely not the case. I wore this and sweated when I wrote my initial review, but after getting wet in the rain, this product seemed to disappear (my reason for removing a star). It has a natural look to it with a 4-fork tip head that lets you create more realistic looking brows. This gets 3 stars for its wearability and durability and application. The formula goes on quite dry so you really have to work in applying yet so it looks even on both brows. However, I like the color and the fork applicator. See my pictures for a before and after (First picture is before and second picture is after application of this product).",0

My initial thoughts on it while applying it in the shower was ""no"" because it provided absolutely no moisturizing qualities to my hair. The conditioner was more like a shampoo and the shampoo was horribly drying! I ended up having to use a seperate extra moisturizing conditioner after I rinsed this out. I was pretty sure this was going to be given away to someone at that point. Then I got out of the shower and styled my hair and it looked really nice and all the brassiness was gone. So now I'm really conflicted. I may end up keeping it with the knowledge that it needs an extra conditioning step but if that becomes annoying these may be given away.",0

One thing to note though - the first picture in the listing made me hope that the colors would have some shimmer in them, but they definitely don’t. Looking at the other pictures, this matches up, but that shimmer was the most noticeable thing to me in the first picture so I just thought I’d mention it.<br />These polishes do cure within 60 seconds, and give decent coverage. Most of them gave full coverage in two coats, but a couple (mainly the yellow), I’d consider a third coat for. Since the polishes are quite neon, are gel (meaning fast and easy to work with), and this is standard especially for yellow neons, I’m not upset about it. Honestly, when I added a top coat over just two coats, it ended up looking pretty good, but I’d still probably add that third coat just to be sure, because… It’s neon yellow. But, overall, I’m happy with the polishes! At 8 mL, they’re also a decent sized bottle for gel polishes.",1

Not only do they pack light - I can stick one little tin in my bag and it takes up almost no space at all, but the sheets themselves are tiny.

I found it difficult to get a decent lather from the sheets, even when using 2 or 3 at a time. This makes them less than ideal for bathing. However, I did get them to do a great job for cleaning just my hands. I would suggest them for cleaning hands while on the go. The scent is very light when added to water. A tin is included, which is a bit more durable than the paper envelopes. The tin slides open, matchbox style. I would recommend using the tin as it will withstand being transported in a pocket, purse or bag better than the paper envelopes. If you anticipate being exposed to rain, I would suggest to place the tin and/or envelopes into a plastic bag. Using water and friction is superior to using hand sanitizer, and with the soap sheets you will be able to maintain much cleaner hands while out and about.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable soap for bathing, I would still suggest to use bar soap wrapped in wax paper inside a plastic bag. If you are in situations where you need to wash hands without soap provided, these are ideal for that need. I would recommend the soap sheets as they are easy to transport and cost effective for hand washing. I hope you find my experience helpful and kindly will click the button below.",1

Second, the glass has a rainbow look to it. Third, they’re small and most small things are cute!<br /><br />They have a kind of felt on the bottom, which can keep it from scratching a surface if it slides, which is nice. But, it also means it slides easily. These are meant to be dappen dishes, so they are supposed to be used for liquids you’d use when doing your nails, such as slip solution, polish, etc. I found it had a habit of slipping easily when I dipped a brush in and wasn’t being careful about it (like if I dipped in and kind of hit the side). As long as I gently dipped into the dish, I didn’t have issues with it sliding, and even when it did slide it wasn’t a big deal because it’s not like it slid all the way across the table. Just something to be aware of.<br /><br />The lids are clear, which I thought was interesting. I’m not sure why they don’t have the rainbow look like the bottom, but it doesn’t look bad with the clear lids. I love that these came with lids that actually fit. I previously saw dappen dishes I wanted, but they had these huge lids that just kind of sat on top of the dishes, so I didn’t get them. These lids actually fit the bottoms so I’m happy about that!<br /><br />Even though these are meant to be dappen dishes, they can be used for many other things you might need a little container for. They’re very small, so there aren’t a ton of uses I can think of. But, they’d work for any kind of liquid or small items you’d want to put in them (like on your dresser to put your earrings and rings in when you take them off at the end of the night).<br /><br />I think these are great dishes.

Good lather, I don’t really smell a “scent”, hands wash clean. They don’t dry out, but I do use a moisturizing sanitizer, and hand lotion after.<br /><br />I wouldn’t say these go years – if you’re like me and using them as an alternative to other hand soaps to preserve waste, they might last about a month (8 washes per day, 30 days). If only as travel backup – they might last a few years. Again, it depends on how they’re used.<br /><br />I personally find them a bit on the pricey side at almost $10 before tax.

We find it best to apply more than one coat, although Pine is not incorrect in advertising that one coat is essentially equal to two of those from other companies.  The chameleon set’s colors look amazing and although not exactly like the stickers on the top of the polishes, they still are good enough to tell which is which.  The different colors are a great combination and allow for salon quality finishes.  I have found the Pine gel nail polishes last a very long time when you properly prepare your nails before application, and when you allow the polish to have sufficient cure times.

AGPCJNECQMG7LPLITZVHXP3F2HUA,B085TFXLH1,5,2021-07-20 05:28:44.969,Cat eye gel nails are amazing!,"Pine gel nail polish smells great, looks amazing, and lasts a long time.  The dark blue is our favorite color and we love that you can get the deep color with great glitter and shine using just one coat, on top of the base coat.  There are no base or top coats included, but as long as you have them, the set, along with a nail clipper and file is all you need to have salon quality manicure and pedicure.  The magnet included with the kit is rectangular, as shown, and is effective at making long streaks on the nails.  With some practice, you’ll be able to create very defined cat eyes, but make sure you keep the cure lights right nearby, or you’ll lose the streaking.  Additionally, make sure that you buff the nails lightly, clean the nails thoroughly, and run full cure times if you want to have the nail polish last more than two weeks.  Following this simple procedure will hopefully give you a high quality and long lasting finish like I have experienced.  I recommend Pine Gel Nail Polish and am sure you’ll be super happy with the results.",1

My head size is larger & my hair thick, so these are almost the best. They are also thinner & cooler.<br />However,  the fabric color looks much lighter when stretched & the buttons are a little smaller than I prefer. But what I took 1 star off for was the fact that the buttons are too far back on the band, which makes the mask way too tight on my face. Also, if you have a small, petite head with flat hair, you might find that these do not stay in place like 1 reviewer stated.<br />I have many 1 inch bright colored buttons which I have sewn on other headbands,  so I will try to sew some about 2 inches forward on these. The problem with the thicker cotton ones are that they are too small, tight, uncomfortable & do not stretch as much, feeling like your head is in a vice. Not this one.",1

From the foaming hand soap I have the coconut and vanilla, and the lavender and aloe. I thought the lavender and aloe sheets would smell the same as the foaming soap but it does not. Far from it. The sheets smell far too musky, strong, and more like men’s cologne on my hands. Not a fan of that one, but glad the smell doesn’t last long after the hand washing. The bergamot and Ylang ylang, and the jasmine and patchouli both smell nice but it is mild. I would say the bergamot and ylang ylang is a neutral smell, while the jasmine and patchouli are more flowery and a bit more feminine. Like I said, both are mild and after drying off my hands I can barely smell them already. One little pack fits into all my regular little inside purse pockets. I always keep soap on hand, especially since I’m allergic to most soaps kept in public restrooms and these soaps are great.",1

Once you get the hang of putting these on you can do it pretty quick, just watch lots of tutorials on utube and you will be a pro in no time!<br /><br />The only critique I have is that I wish the hair were just a bit thicker. It’s gorgeous hair and it’s nice and long and easy to work with, but it’s just not very thick. Which kind of limits who can use it.

I’ve had these in for almost 2 weeks and I’m probably going to take it out this weekend because as nice as they look, the top of my head is constantly itchy. I thought it was just bc they were fresh braids and my scalp was adjusting. But I’ve tried non stop oiling my scalp and it’s still irritated and it leaves my scalp very dry. As cute as the color is, I don’t think I’d ever order synthetic braiding hair from a random Amazon seller again because I’ve never had this kind of itching with kanekalon hair. :( I had to take off 2 stars because of the itching.<br /><br />July 22:<br />So I ended up buying 2 packs of the 10-pc bundles because I wanted to be sure that I had more than enough hair to get my hair braided. I read the reviews and was a little nervous about the hair not being able to seal, but I didn't have that issue. I also read that people were saying the hair made them itch like crazy so I prewashed it in ACV and no film came off the hair. So, possibly the more colorful bundles don't have that lye coating?<br /><br />Anyway, I got my hair braided yesterday and it came out great. My braider probably used about 11 or 12 bundles for medium sized box braids and even though she said the hair wasn't sealing perfectly (so she dipped it in hot water twice), it looks fine to me and the braids aren't unraveling. You can also curl the ends by setting them on rods and dipping in water too.<br /><br />As others have said though, the bundles are pretty small so for a full head of individual braids (especially if you're trying to do very small braids), you're probably going to want to order more than one pack.",0

I stopped just because I started to take other supplements (pre-natals, etc) and it was just getting to be too much I had to cut out some of the stuff. I still really like the Sibu brand and their sea buckthorn oil. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they now have skincare products. My favorite product in this set is still the sea buckthorn supplements (60 softgels). I am still nursing so I won't be taking this just yet but I am just about done nursing. The supplement is one thing I am looking forward to taking again. The expiration date is listed on the bottom of the bottle. I do like the smell of the anytime face wash, and it  did a nice job of cleaning my face without drying it out. I do get little hormonal breakouts here and there so this is a good face wash for me. I've also tried the daily facial defense oil, a zit zapper, but it is too soon to tell if it works. It does a great job of moisturizing my face for sure as it is packed with different kinds of oils (argan, sea buckthorn, lavender, patchouli, etc). All these products are made in the USA, which I know is important for some people. This is a good set of skincare basics for acne prone skin. I like the more ""natural"" approach with the use of sea buckthorn oil and less harsh chemicals. This product came in a cardboard box (like a subscription style box) and placed inside a bubble foil zip loc style bag. Good packaging.<br /><br />Some improvements ideas for this product:<br />- supplement does not say how many to take per day. The supplement facts says ""serving size 2 vegan softgels"", so I am assuming that means I should be taking 2 pills a day, making this a 1 month supply. There is no information pamphlet in the box or in this Amazon description page<br />- ingredients list for all 3 products should be listed on this Amazon page, I didn't see it listed yet<br />- brand name is confusing and made it hard for me to do more research on this product. Is the name of this product line ""NOT OR"" or ""Not for him or her"" or ""NxO"" or ""NO""? It is just all very confusing. Either way, all of the names still made it hard to do a search because it sounds like it is a part of a sentence.",1

AEHGY7TZA4IMOXXBGPTZC7UPM6UQ,B093QGZ9ND,1,2021-08-05 05:52:15.031,UPDATE!  Contains MMA.,"UPDATE!<br /><br />I’m so positive this mon9mer contains MMA which has been banned on the US because it it so toxic. I came to this conclusion when I tried to remove the nails. Non MMA monomer nails come off easily after soaking in acetone. You need to file the surface, then soak them for 10-20 minutes. You then scrape it off and it comes off in flakes and bits and pieces. You may need to do this more than once. With MMA, you use the same process, but once you start scraping it is a sticky, messy process and as soon as the nail is out of the acetone, it immediately starts to solidify so you really have to do it over and over again, or do the scraping while the nails are in the acetone.<br /><br />This monomer works well, doesn’t cause my white to yellow at all, but it reeks! Just opening the box I was overwhelmed by the smell. It only got worse once I opened it. After using it for a while I went nose blind, which happens with all sorts of smells, but when my husband got home from work he told me to go outside to use it, lol!",0

The clips work fine on my junior bunnies, but on my adult bunnies, they are not able to catch all of the bunnies bangs to get the wool out of their eyes. After some humorous trial & error I found that these work beautifully as a side clip on my adult bunnies. 🦋 A reviewer stated they held a lot of hair; they don't. I'm sure they are fine for kids as advertised, but not a lot of adult hair (or bunny wool) as was implied in the review.<br /><br />The clip part feels very strong, like it is made of metal. You pinch one end & it opens up so you can slide it into the hair, then let go. Really simple to use.<br /><br />I docked a star because of the packaging 🤬 These came in the cello bag pictured. This means they slid all around & bunched on each other causing 3 of the 12 to become permanently disfigured. I have been trying to get the wings corrected, but they just want to stay like they are.

AFBOCEST4IRAQO3SZVXLCGSL2EBQ,B098SC44N6,5,2021-08-10 19:24:11.646,So far so good,"I really enjoy this kit so far, although I just put the lashes on for the first time today. I love having a glue and bond in a single tube, because I always apply glue using the mini mascara wand and then apply another brush-applicator glue to the band before I apply and fuse. This glue is less sticky than my favorite Calailis glue, so it’s definitely easier to work with. I don’t know yet how it’s going to hold up. The lashes themselves are beautiful, very similar to the Easitension lashes which are great beginner lashes since they are so easy to apply.  I love the wand on the Glass coating, which is a straight dupe of Lashify Glass.  The little fluffy knob on the end of the wand makes it easier to get into small areas like the tops of the lashes. I barely feel like this glue/bond combo needs a sealer though since there’s just not a lot of stickiness to deal with. Really the only other thing that you need to complete this kit is a good applicator tool, because I don’t care for using the regular set of tweezers included.  Not only is the angle not great for application, but there’s no way to fuse unless you use your fingers which I don’t care to do. I will update this review when I find out more about the longevity of the lashes. I always wait 24 hours before getting my lashes wet and that seems to allow them to cure properly.",1

Good power.,"This is quite an impressive battery powered nail drill. It's a very credible device, with a motor capable of 35000rpm.  So, it has the power. Visually, it has an attractive design with a professional/industrial aspect. The metallic body of the drill body exhibits durability and sturdiness.<br />The top segment of the drill handle twists, with a marker that indicates position respective to the locked/unlocked icons. Obviously, these position are for removing/inserting drill bits. Make sure that after inserting the selected drill bit, the top is twisted and engaged in the locked position.<br />The battery pack also doubles as the control module for the drill. The silvery knob (plastic) turns on the power and gives access to the variable speed settings.  When powered, the display shows the direction of rotation, F/R, and the speed. The button below the display allows the user to change the direction of drill rotation. Under that button, marked Status,  toggles the display from direction and speed to the current power status of the battery. (In the attached photo, P91 indicates Power 91%)<br />The controls are easy to understand, and manage. There's a belt clip on the back of the battery pack/control module. You can opt to have it affixed to a belt or pocket, or place the pack on the table where you can easily make adjustments.<br />in terms of battery efficiency, it takes 2 - 3 hours to fully charge a depleted battery, while affording up to 20 hours of operating time. Actual time will depend on speed and application load. I would expect actual real time use to realize over 10 hours of operation. The charging:operating time ratio is very impressive.<br />I've seen/used prosumer level nail drills, very similar to this product. Those units can range in prices over $100.  Based on comparative costs, this is priced very well in the market genre. In other words, it's a very good value for the features and quality.<br />Based on these considerations, this portable nail drill earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",1

This is a very expensive and small quantity of sunscreen, but I think if you look at it for particular application it might be worth it. I used it entirely for a face sunscreen. It does extremely well to saturate into the skin and I didn't find it gave me a white cast at all, which is what I really appreciate about it. It can do very well as an everyday wearing type sunscreen that will give you protection from the sun, while at the same time moisturizing your skin. As a matter of fact, I found as a moisturizer it worked very well. I appreciate very much the sun protection SPF 50 that it has, because the sun where I live can certainly get very strong. I usually dislike sunscreens, because of the oily nature of them, but I found this one to be well balanced, and didn't leave me feeling greasy at all. I also found that it had a bit of a matte finish to it, so you didn't notice any sort of shining, especially for someone like me who tends to have an oilier t zone. In combination with that, I actually get dry areas on my chin, and this did very nicely to moisturize my dry areas while not causing any sort of exacerbation of oilier areas. All in all it's probably one of the best, if not the best sunscreen that I have ever used for my face. For everyday wear, and protection, I would certainly reach for this sunscreen without a doubt. I do recommend it.",1

AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,B08KFKKPBB,4,2021-08-20 12:33:19.832,pretty decent,"This vitamin C and lemon peel brightening cleanser does a great job of cleaning the skin very effectively.  Just to give you an idea, I have an oilier type T-Zone as well as dryer areas on my chin to give me a bit of a combination type skin. While I appreciate it how well this cleanser cleansed, I did find it very drying. I was in absolute need of a moisturizer, and serum after using it. I guess that wasn't that bad, considering that I always use serums and moisturizers anyways.  I certainly wouldn't be able to use this cleanser on its own, as a face wash and go type product. It really needs to be followed up with other skin care products. That being said it does cleanse extremely well, and has a very pleasant scent to it. Surely if you're somebody who has oilier skin, I think you would appreciate how well this will alleviate you of that issue either at the end of the day, or before the day gets started. If however, you are somebody who has a dryer type skin, you might be over exacerbating that issue with this cleanser. All in all, I think it depends on your skin type as to whether this is the cleanser for you. For my combination type skin, I liked it very much on my oily areas, but less so of course on the dryer spots I have around my chin.",1

The other thing about that, is that the scent actually hangs around for a while after you exit the shower. It leaves you smelling nice and tropical. From an aromatherapy perspective, it makes the shower experience really lovely. Couple of pumps on the old loofah, and it lathers up extremely well for full body coverage. I can't stand body washes that require half the bottle to maintain a good lather. This one is not one of those. It cleans very nicely, and does a bang up job of leaving me feeling nicely hydrated as well. So the natural moisture from my skin is not stripped away, and I'm left feeling clean and smelling wonderful. I actually lost it to my wife, who gave it a try and insisted that it was no longer mine, and that I was not allowed to touch it. Because I consider myself a gentleman, I gave in to her demands, and sadly gave her all of the wonderful shower experiences going forward from that point on. That being said, it speaks to how nice a shower experience you'll get from this body wash. I do recommend it.",1

I found that my foundation looks a bit cakey and this face oil, really gives me a nice dowy finish.

A very small amount of the cleanser does a great job of deeply cleaning pores and removing dead skin cells. My face feels fresh and clean after cleansing. But it does dry out my skin a bit.  Because I follow up using toner and moisturizer, this isn't a huge deal for me and doesn't prevent me from continuing to use Tinazana cleanser.  There is a light, faint, fresh scent that I enjoy. Surprisingly, it doesn't smell like pineapple to me.  It also doesn't last; when I rinse the cleanser off, I can no longer detect the scent at all.<br /><br />Due to skin sensitivity issues, I sometimes have issues with citrus based products. I know pineapple technically isn't a citrus fruit but I was a bit concerned it might be too harsh on my skin. Its not. No burning or itching at all.<br /><br />I like this cleanser a lot.

I needed brush protectors and got a great cleaning mat with them!,"While most people would probably purchase this for the cleaning mat and have the included brush protectors be a bonus, I got this mainly for the brush protectors and the cleaning mat was a bonus.<br /><br />I have natural haired brushes - some expensive, some mid range. My mid range ones, the hairs can sometimes get kind of splayed out when they’re drying if they don’t have something holding them in place. With the MANY brush sets I’ve gotten, I have gotten tons of the brush protectors that came on the bigger brushes, but those were stretched out from being on a brush already, so I needed new ones. These are great. Since they stretch out when you put them on a brush, if you use one for a bigger sized brush, you’ll either have to always use that protector for the same brush or at least a brush of the same size. The same goes for the ones you use on smaller brushes. I only have a few brushes that need the brush protectors, so I can easily keep track of which ones go on which brushes, so it’s not a big deal for me. Before I had the brush protectors, I would take a piece of toilet paper, split it into 1 ply, and the tightly wrap that around the brush to hold the hairs in place while it dried. This worked fine, but it was a hassle to have to get the toilet paper and split it into plys. Then when it would get wet from the brush when I was trying to roll the toilet paper around the brush, it would start to rip. So, using these brush protectors is a lot less hassle! And I can just continue to reuse the same one on the same brushes, so it’s not like the toilet paper where I’d have to get a new one every time!<br /><br />The brush cleaning mat is just a basic silicone brush cleaning mat. It has little suctions on the bottom so you can place it on the counter to have it hold in place while you scrub the brushes on it, which is nice so it won’t be moving around.<br /><br />There’s different textures for different types of brushes. The product page states what each one is for…<br /><br />The pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears is to rinse smaller brushes. (Notice this area says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes, while the heart shaped area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes).<br /><br />The thick striped pattern around the ears is to “reshape big makeup brushes.” I’m not sure what reshape them means.<br /><br />The 2 big dot patterns below the eyes is “suitable for blush brushes, separating oil by up and down friction.”<br /><br />The small dot pattern that goes around the 2 areas of big dot pattern is suitable for cleaning eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />The I-shaped area on the left side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />The heart shaped areas in the middle of the body is for scrubbing small brushes. Notice this area says it’s for SCRUBBING smaller brushes, while the pinstripe pattern at the top between the ears says it’s for RINSING smaller brushes).<br /><br />The U-shaped area on the right side of the body is suitable for cleaning concealer and eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />Personally, I don’t really notice if one area cleans brushes better than other areas. I tend to use the ones that have bigger, higher up grooves, like the heart shaped area for scrubbing brushes that have foundation and concealer in them. I find these really get in there and clean out the liquid foundation/concealer well. Any of the smaller areas work well for my eyeshadow brushes.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great little set. You get the cleaning mat which is a good size with many different areas and has the suction cups on the bottom that can hold it in place. Plus you get the brush protection nets, which is nice. So, I definitely recommend it if you’re looking for both or even just one!",1

The I am Fine color is reddish-brown, but it was a very nice red color on my lips. And my fingers - be careful when you apply these since they do stain. It's best to exfoliate before you use them, and to line your lips since I noticed a bit of bleeding/feathering when I used the product. Nothing that was obvious unless one was very close, but it would be prevented from lining my lips which I don't normally think to do when using a stain. Then again, the applicator is a cotton swab (so no fine control) and you get a LOT of product with it.<br /><br />It does last all day unless you eat something greasy/buttery.

The head doesn't pivot  but it doesn't need to thanks to the 38.5 degree shaving angle. It glides perfectly along the jaw line and chin areas without missing a spot.<br /><br />The base is heavy-ish and holds the razor well. Doesn't tip or wobble.<br /><br />He's not a fan of the shaving foam. Says he must 'really rub it in' in order for it to foam.  He used it once and switched back to his regular brand.<br /><br />Suprent has really come out with an awesome razor kit. The presentation is gorgeous and the product works exceptionally well.  Without a doubt this is worthy of gift giving.  The price is reasonable.<br /><br />Highly recommended",1

However, on my neck and cheeks, it does well, particularly with a dry shave.<br /><br />The foam is nice but nothing special. Doesn't slick up great but has a nice scent.

Yes, you could probably get all the things in it a little cheaper, but for convenience, this is a win.

In total there are five items. The bath bombs spell MOM with the heart substituting for the letter O.<br /><br />The outside packaging looks giftable but the inside is just an ordinary uninspiring throw-away box. The fragrance of the bombs and soap is hardly noticeable. It has a whisper of rose aroma and I detect no lavender at all. I did try the letter M bomb in a hand bath and it dissolved in 5 minutes in lukewarm water and a nice foam of suds lasted about 10 minutes. The results initially felt moisturizing because my hands felt a little oily after the hand bath; however, eventually I needed to moisturize my hands with lotion.<br /><br />With regard to the dried petals, one has to like something like that in their bath because it requires straining the water so that they don't go down the drain. For me, I would never use petals in a bath, so keep the recipient in mind when ordering this.<br /><br />The bar of soap is the only item that would be used by most people.<br /><br />One thing I love is that the color of the dissolved bomb did not adhere to my skin, my hand bath, or my towel. That is not always the case with bath bombs today.<br /><br />The current price of $9.74 ($12.99 minus 25%) comes to $1.95 per item which is reasonable.",0

The angle of the head is a little different than others I have but I find maneuvering with it easy enough on most parts of my face. It gives me a nice close shave on my face and chin. Although it's a bit heavy, I don't find that an impediment. The included base holds the razor upright and is nice looking, with the same substantial feel as the razor itself. The included shave cream is ok.<br /><br />On the downside, the head is quite large. That made it hard to maneuver in the area between my chin and lower lip. I also couldn't find any information on how to get replacement blades, a must for a manual razor. I looked on the Suprent web site and found the razor but not any blades. Hopefully, that will be corrected soon. Since the design of the blade cartridge is unique, I imagine the cost of the blades will be quite high, as is that of the razor.",0

I firmly believe that nature provides us with a valuable top layer to our skin, and that ritually grinding off this layer forces our skin to constantly try to regain equilibrium and add more of the oils and blemishes that we're trying to rid ourselves of.<br /><br />So when I look at masks like this, I look for things that sooth and *add* instead of extracting and *subtracting* from our skin.<br /><br />I think this one is a winner.

Good for someone who doesn’t need too much.,"A little while back I got an eyebrow stamp kit like this and loved it! The only thing I wished was that the eyebrow stamp was a little thinner. When I saw this kit and saw the stamp looked a lot thinner than the one I had, I had to try it!<br /><br />This comes with the brow stamp, 24 brow stencils, and 4 spoolie brushes.<br /><br />Theres a whopping 24 eyebrow stencils included in this kit! That’s crazy! So, I’m sure most everyone can find a shape that they like for their brows among these stencils. Unlike most kits that have brow stencils like these, these have adhesive backing that sticks to you. Most kits I’ve gotten like these the stencils are plastic, so reusable. I like that they stick because you don’t have to worry about holding them perfectly in place while also trying to use the stamp to fill in your brows and worry about it moving some. But, I don’t like that they aren’t really reusable like this since once you pull off the backing and stick them on, they won’t stick anymore.<br /><br />The first time I tried a brow powder stamping kit I wasn’t expecting much. I kind of expected this to make ugly, thick, blocky looking eyebrows. But, this actually works great! The product in the stamp is powder, so it creates a nice, light color, and you can dab more to build it up if you want. Once you use the spoolie, it looks pretty natural. You can also add pencil to if you wanted.<br /><br />I don’t have thick brows, but I don’t have extremely sparse brows. My brows are thinner, where you can see skin poking through, but there’s basically an even amount of hair all the way across. I used to just leave my brows be, but when I do a full face of makeup I do feel like my brows need a little something. So, I started doing my brows. I usually do a little tinted brow gel. It usually gives enough tint to make them look a little fuller and complete, but not so much where they look too thick. I feel like since I’m just starting to do my brows, whenever I have them filled completely I think they look too thick and weird 😂 So, I like a middle area. So, using this stamp works well for me. If I’m doing full glam, I like to apply it to get a kind of light wash of color. Then, I’ll kind of go over the tail a little with some more powder to darken it a little more. Then, I’ll take a brow pencil and do a few kind of hair like strokes in the front. Sometimes I’ll go in and do some brow gel if I feel they need more defined. This fills them out nicely, makes them look complete, but doesn’t make them look too dark or full. If I am doing a more natural look, I’ll just use the brow powder in the stamp. I do feel that there isn’t a ton of product that comes out and I’m not sure how much product is in the stamp. I don’t mind that not a lot comes out, I actually prefer it. But, if you wanted more product, it might be kind of annoying for you.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice little set! It is a nice way to try different brow shapes to see what you like for yourself. The product works well. The brow powder looks natural and lasts nicely in the brows. I would definitely recommend this for someone who isn’t sure about their brow shape - what they like best on their face, what shape works best, how to fill in brows, etc. This set will help with those things! If you’re someone that just likes a little wash of color and fuller, more filled out brows, this would help with that. If you’re someone who likes a lot of color in the brows, you might not like this since it just gives a wash of color. So, I would recommend it but only if you’re someone who wants to try out different brow shapes to get an idea of what works for you or if you’re someone who likes a light wash of color throughout their brows.",1

Inside, there is a wrapped square bar of scented soap, a box of dried rose petals that look and smell pretty, and three rose and lavender scented bath bombs that spell out the word ""MOM.""

The Aoraem requires you to turn the entire top half of the unit to power it. That’s fine for turning it on, but when you try to turn it off, it can loosen the bottom tray and the particles spill out if you’re not careful.

From the blades and the curve of the handle, to the stylish holder. It oozes style and luxury. That is until you actually want to use it…<br /><br />Just as they claim the handle is alloy and has a good bit of weight to it.

The razor head is fixed in what they call an “optimum angle”, except it’s really not. Imagine trying to keep your grip on one of those slippery snakes, while trying to maneuver your hand at all kinds of odd angles to get that “optimum angle”, while 6 nice and sharp blades are around your jugular….<br /><br />Unfortunately this looks great, but functionally it doesn’t perform.

The handle is fairly comfortable to hold and the frame of the razor head has a moisturizing coating that gets activated with water and helps lubricate skin for easy gliding. The razor blades are sharp and help achieve a clean shave. This is supposedly good for about 2 months of use, after which the replacement head that comes with the razor can be changed. I also love the ceramic base that the razor comes with and can be stored in.<br />Now for the critical part. Although the handle is comfortable, the slick coating may make it a little slippery if using in the shower. The magnetic razor heads, although a unique and interesting feature, are impossible to find the replacement for. Even the seller's page only lists the razor itself, but not the replacement heads. This means that after the 2 heads that the razor comes with have been used up, you would have to purchase a new razor.",0

Fine lines are thinned. My dry, sensitive skin looks and feels refreshed.  And thanks to Vitamin C, my normally dull skin has a dewy glow.  I've not found many products that are able to do this to my skin but XXI does!<br /><br />I have dry , sensitive skin and have no issues with this cream<br /><br />XXI works. It works VERY well and some results like soft, smooth skin occur immediately after use.  Results are long lasting.  XXI recommends using this in the morning and at night. I use it once a day in the morning.  A very small amount is sufficient to cover my face.  Because it works so well and delivers great results and only a small amount is needed per use, I do believe the price is reasonable. However, if you find this isn't right for you, XXI offers a 30 day satisfaction guarantee. I absolutely recommend XXI Bio-Pure lotion.",1

The pots can be difficult to get the full nail in so getting a dipping tray helps shake the powder on top of the nails. Good thing this kit includes a dipping tray. Nice selection of colors. Definitely recommend for anyone new that is into dip nails. If you need help with removal. It's best to do some research as these can be quite difficult and time-consuming.

Overall these colors are wonderful, the bottle sizes are small which is on the downside but did you go a long way. few these colors are very see-through so you have to do multiple layers, but sometimes that gives it a better look. this kit is good to add to your collection or add to a starter kit it does require UV light to cure. This one does take a little bit longer to dry and cure but that's what the topcoat would be to help with that. I would make sure they are thoroughly cured between coats before you start applying another coat of the color because otherwise the coat underneath will not cure correctly and it will leave a sticky residue on your nail and peel off.",1

I've been using a straight razor for some time, but these cartridge type razors are definitely easier to use and less likely to produce accidental cuts. I was excited to try this, and in general, it's been pretty good, but not amazing. The razor itself is quite heavy and looks very cool. The cartridge fits easily and is easy to change if necessary. There's also the heavy base piece to stand the razor up. The shaving cream is not that great. It comes out of the can with impressive body, but once you start applying it to your face, it deflates and just doesn't provide awesome coverage. The razor is smooth on the skin, but because of its asymmetrical design, it's less comfortable in the left hand. I'm right handed, but I still switch between hands when I'm shaving different sides of my face. It would have been better if they made it symmetrical.

Then I apply a Hyaluronic Acid serum on my skin.  After that, I use this Vitamin C lotion and I finish with the XXI firming lotion on top of that.  I only do this 1 time at night.<br /><br />RESULTS<br />The results of this product line have been really impressive.  My face has looked younger, more glowy, and my skin looks more awake and less tired.  I have been through a lot of deaths this year and my face has looked very tired.  I could not believe how much this and the other two XXI products affected how I look.  It was quite exciting for me right now.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />My skin glows after using this.

I love that this is dense because it does not absorb liquid foundation as some other less dense sponges I tried previously<br /><br />What attracted me to this the most are the angles.The two flat sides are great for smooth applications. The tip is great for more precision, such as around the eye. The round ends are good for blending or any large make-up application.<br /><br />This feels good to hold, blends well, and feels soft against my skin.  Also, the sponge does not smell.<br /><br />In summary, this blender makes a great gift for the make-up obsessed. The only reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price. The current price of $7.50 is on the pricey side. I tried other blenders of this quality that sell for less than half this price when purchased in a pack of three or more. For instance this [[ASIN:B08QCJ3DF7 set]] currently sells for $2.50 per sponge as there are 4 sponges for $9.99. Even though all the angles are not in one sponge, the functionality is still there and they are dense, which I like.",1

Installing this hair was easy for me because installing so many different hairs that I became a master, of course, I think it will not be difficult for someone who is not a professional, it may just take a while. One of the good things about this hair color is that I ordered this hair precisely because of its color, because the hair turns blonde and spreads well in the hair. Some time ago, I went to the bathroom with this hair, and then I said to myself, maybe hot water will cause the hair to lose its color or its design to be damaged, but I saw that nothing new has happened.

I waited 4 hours and my hair still wasn't dry so it didn't curl. I will be trying it again.<br /><br />The box comes with a hair curler and clips. It also comes with 4 scrunchies, 2 large and 2 small. There is also a beautiful, drawstring bag to store everything and instructions.<br /><br />I will be recommending this JODK Heatless Curling Rod Headband to family and friends because it is so cute.",1
AGSI52Y6GEY7X5TLS7QOWFYVYD5Q,B083PXJBVY,3,2021-10-15 16:29:33.889,Pretty equal to a regular conditioner,"I appreciate that this product uses natural ingredients and is cruelty free and paraben free. I was hoping that this would be a great moisturizing treatment for my hair, but I think it is probably geared more for scalp moisturizing.  Since I do not have issues with dry scalp I can not give an accurate review on the effectiveness there.  I can say that this stuff smells really good. It is a floral scent that almost reminds me of rose, but far less obnoxious.  You really only smell it during use so it isn't one that lingers.  It did leave my hair feeling pretty soft, which is nice, but it tangled really easily immediately after rinsing.  I have very fine hair so that is pretty common, but still annoying.  However, after washing and detangling, I do think my hair looked pretty good.  I think this is a pretty good product, but it feels pretty much like any normal conditioner to me, rather than a hair mask. Considering the price, I was hoping for a little more.  I would like to find somebody with a very dry scalp to try it out to see if it benefits them more than it did me.",0

I love the sponges as they are dense.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are dense, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These are also perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />At the current price of $8.49 ($9.99 minus 15%) these are a reasonable $.85 per sponge.",1
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,B09XX4VR4Y,5,2021-10-15 23:38:54.612,These bandages have many uses; sticks to itself and not to skin or fur; not only tattoo grip tape,"These bandages have many uses. There are 16 black rolls that are individually wrapped and each roll is 5 yards apiece and 2 inches tall. These self-adhere as the bandage is wrapped around a hand, leg, arm, etc. These stick well. The stretch allows this to be used like kinesiology tape with the exception that one cannot shower with this successfully and each wrap is for one-time use.<br /><br />The entire roll does not have to be used at once as it depends on the amount needed. When used where joints open and close, such as a knee or elbow, the wrap may bunch up in the crease as expected. However, this is perfect to use as a lightweight version of a carpal tunnel brace by wrapping it around a bad wrist, hand, and thumb. It does not stick to my skin nor to a pet's fur, which is wonderful.<br /><br />This is versatile enough to wrap around the handle of a tennis racquet to get a good grip or an umbrella or cane handle. There are just so many useful possibilities besides medical reasons.<br /><br />In summary, because the wraps are two inches wide and are not designed to stick to the skin, it does have a tendency to bunch up if wrapped around a knee or elbow, so it is not perfect for everything. I feel these are great bandages to have in one's medicine cabinet. At the current price of $15.19 ($15.99 minus 5%) it comes to $.95 cents per roll which is on the high side of competitively priced. These are self-adhesive bandages rebranded as tattoo grip tape.",1
AEI2TWH7BUSHC5YVK4KCCYPPMXZA,B094TBJ2QN,5,2021-10-16 18:21:00.384,Awesome set,"I am extremely impressed with this skincare set. First off, it is presented like a gift, which just tickled me. Everyone likes gifts, and receiving this in the box with the cool carrying pouch and the compliment on the inside of the box felt great! I really like this touch. Second, the products themselves are great. Obviously, that’s going to be the major selling point, but it always helps when companies treat their customers really well from the onset, so I was already feeling great about these starting out.<br /><br />Now about the products. The soft gels are awesome. Those are what I started first. I actually got this kit because I have dealt with blepharitis for over ten years. If you have ever dealt with this then you know how extremely difficult it is to treat. I’d heard that one effective treatment at controlling it was sea buckthorn, so I was willing to try this. The soft gels are medium size gels, and I started those right away, the day I received the kit. They are easy to swallow and I simply added them in with my other supplements.<br /><br />The next morning I started the wash. The wash has been nice. I use it both on my face and to cleanse the eye area thoroughly, and on my back where I have some issues with adult acne. My back hasn’t really had any change with this product, but my face and eyes have seen some benefit already. My eyes in particular are looking a ton better, which is not only a relief but also super amazing. I am going to continue to use these products and we’ll see how things go. I hope that there will be continued relief and improvement the longer I use them.<br /><br />I admit that I haven’t used the oil on my face, mostly because I am just not used to an oil on my face, but I have used it on my body and I like it. It has cleared the chronic breakouts I used to get on the back of my neck and so far they haven’t started reappearing. These products are winners, and the fact that they address more than one issue is so awesome. Given the progress I’ve had so far, I definitely recommend this kit.",1

The deodorant relies on essential oils in large part to help control odor, and I love how the bottle reminds you to inhale the aroma of the deodorant and smile before applying. Even just seeing that reminder makes me smile.<br /><br />The scent of this deodorant is spicy but has the creaminess of the vanilla to add that bit of mellowness to take the edge off of the spice. It’s a perfect scent for both men and women, in my opinion. I love the scent. I have very sensitive, unpredictable and allergy prone skin, and I have been good using this deodorant. No skin reaction at all. This has been my favorite “natural” deodorant I’ve ever used. Part of it is the scent, but it’s also the presentation: the glass bottle, the box, the feel good reminders…everything about this deodorant is soulful and pleasant. Highly recommend. Oh, and just wanted to add, this kept me smelling fresh all day. Five stars and more.",1

I absolutely love the smell of this cream, it is very fragranced. It has a nice floral scent that reminds me of being in a field of flowers.  Sensitive skin may not enjoy that much. But, it does feel very luxurious and silky on the skin.<br /><br />My cons are that I did not get any dewy effect from the cream and it actually gave my skin a mattified appearance. I think it just may not be hydrating enough if you have skin on the dry side like mine.<br /><br />While I won’t be using this as my every day moisturizer, I did find that it worked well for me as a makeup base before I apply my foundation.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is that there is a slight hint of shimmer to the cream when looking at it in the jar. It is not chunky and can’t be felt on the skin. It almost looks like the cream has more of a pearlized finish.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this cream to those with oily or combination skin. It just didn’t work the best for my dry skin.",0

So naturally I have been hesitant to use any oil type skin care products on my face.<br />But I have learned that using an oily skin cleanser will not produce more oil on your skin, instead, a good oil cleanser is designed to balance and remove everything but skin's moisture.<br />So I have been searching for one to try out. Since this one is my first cleansing oil, I don’t have any experience with other cleansing oils to compare this with. So my impression about this is as a general cleansing product whether oil or otherwise.<br />The bottom line is that I liked how it worked on removing make-ups and how my skin felt afterwards. It didn’t feel heavy on my oily skin and felt soft and clean after washing my face  following this.",1

I like the design and ribbon on the box. It is a throwaway box  and not a keepsake. The 5 piece is nice, especially for moms. It can be gifted to women in general, but most appealing to mothers because of the design of included bath bombs. The bombs and the hand soap has aromatic fragrance that I like in a relaxed bath. The dried rose pedals are a plus for those who like the added touch. Relative to the price, I give it a 5 star rating.",1

This solves that problem nicely.  It's very soft and pliable and opens with a squeeze of the ends of the container.  It's very easy to use and your sponge fits nicely inside.  It seems quite durable and like it would last a good long time.  It's also easy to clean and allows circulation in case you wash your sponge and it's slightly damp.

The nail polish tends towards the clumpy so I added some thinner. I don't expect perfection anyway with nail polish for kids as the little girl in question doesn't sit still long enough for it to dry properly anyway. But thicker polish is destined to be a problem. So thinner is great.<br />The colours are perfect for a little girl and she was thrilled with this set. Teens... may require something a bit more sophisticated.,1

You obviously aren't going to see overnight results but if you keep at it you will notice a difference on your wrinkles. Luckily I don't have too many yet but I did use it on the little areas where I'm starting to see wrinkles. I noticed a tightening of the areas I used the laser on for the past 3 months. I really liked the hyaluronic acid serum that was included in the set - the serum felt gentle and has no smell (fragrance free). On some days where I didn't use the laser I would still use the serum to moisturize my face. I looked into purchasing just the serum, which they do have for sale, as I really like the product. The laser is easy to operate and charge (usb). I didn't use this daily as I wanted to give my skin a rest, but I think if you used this religiously then you would see results at a much faster rate. It isn't painful, but you feel a little zap. I would equate it to the same level of ""pain"" as a derma roller, that spikey/zappy feeling - not painful, not super uncomfortable. That of course, will depend on your skin sensitivity. I recommend using the lowest setting first then working your way up as your skin sensitivity will allow. Don't force your skin into what it cannot handle - listen to your body's reaction!<br /><br />I've seen so many of these laser type products for the skin/body, and never tried it because I didn't trust it. Nira is the first at home laser product that I decided to give a chance to, as I trust it. Overall I am not disappointed but do know that you need to commit to it if you want to see results. If you are going to use it once every few weeks then it will be a while before you see results, if ever. I plan to keep using this to stimulate my skin.",1

I did take a star away because it's battery operated...which i thought having an electric plug would makee it more convenient and worth it to me, less expensive in the long run.

I have one that I do epson salt soaks in and my daughter kept asking if ai could buy her one. This seemed perfect because of the fun colors,  the bubbles, the music and all the extras. It comes with the little spa sandals, toe dividers, nail polish, press on nails, a nail file, and the machine itself of course,  the machine has two buttons one for bubbles and one for music.

But since the 3 enclosed bath bombs spell MOM, then the box is limited... The gift box wrapping is lovely. Take off the mocha silk ribbon which matches well with the paper, and underneath is a plain cardboard box.<br />I love these combo boxes: inside: 3 bath bombs which are very lightly scented, a box of dried rose petals (yeah potpourri bags) and an adorable, square bar of soap. I put the soap in my shower near the shower head as the water drips release some of the scent over time as the soap melts.<br />Anyway, a very nice, gentle set. I wish the bombs didn't spell MOM as then this would be very giftable to something other than MOM.",1

I love that so many come in the set and the assorted colors are a nice touch.<br /><br />The design of the sponges is simple. There is a flat slanted bottom I like to use for patting in foundation and the pointed tip that is great for concealing or reaching small places around the nose, eyes, etc.<br /><br />The sponges are reasonably sized, but when placed under water they expand greatly! I do think these are great for the money, but for foundation I’m not crazy about the finish it gives. The sponge is somewhat firm, so I feel like it can be hard to really sink the product into the skin, but it is great for concealer or using the sponges dry for powder. Overall, I’m satisfied!",1

I have dry skin and didn't like the overall effect. But my husband has very oily skin and he thinks it is one of the best bars of soap he has ever used. It really got his skin clean without making it feel dry.<br /><br />This soap doesn't suds up to much, it is almost like washing with an ultra fine pumice stone that really gets the skin clean.

I love the combination of items, it is almost like opening gifts on Christmas and pulling out one item after the other. I love the soap bar and the bath bombs. The candle is also a nice touch and smelled amazing! This is probably silly, but my favorite item in the box was actually the bottle opener that is shaped like a key. It is so unique and functional, and something that will last a long time. I was not so impressed with the wine stopper. It looks like metal but is made of plastic. I also don't really like messages on my cups, so would have preferred that to be plain or with a graphic/picture design. The cup itself is good and has a nice sliding lid that fits quite snuggly.

This review is for: Acuaiss Cleansing Eyelid Wipes, Hygienic & Hydrating Eyelid Wipes with Hyaluronic Acid and Aloe Vera...<br /><br />These wipes are very handy! Because they are individually wrapped you can tuck one in your pocket or your purse. The wipes themselves are large enough to wipe both eyes with no problems.<br /><br />I requested these mostly for the morning. With my allergies being so bad this year, I often wake up with some serious eye gunk. These are great for that! They are gentle enough and I don't have to worry about any stinging or other issues.<br /><br />Regarding ordering, for whatever reason these took a few weeks to come in, and when they finally arrived the box was pretty beat up. There were no worries though, as far as the product itself is concerned, I just thought I'd mention it.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with these eye wipes.",1

I have a problem in that NONE of the contents have ingredients listed, though.  So, although the soap looks beautiful and fancy – I do not know what is in it or what it is made of.  Same goes for the bath bombs – no ingredients whatsoever.  (One I like the smell of – the other not so much.)  Because of this these items definitely come off dollar store-like.  The wine tumbler seems well made and comes with a straw and straw brush.  The candle says it is soy wax which is nice but to me it smells terrible.  The weird part is that the gift box comes with a plastic wine topper.  Now the wine bottle topper “looks” nice but it is 100% plastic – worse than dollar store...  It also comes with what looks like a random decorative metal key that serves no function and does not go with the contents at all.  Yet it is a bottle top opener – for beer…  That is so weird to me and I will be taking this out before gifting this gift set as no wine I know of has a pop top – twist off sure – but beer cap?  For the price, they need to truly step it up in regards to the contents - include ingredients and include a better wine stopper.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button.

Since I wear contacts, I put the drops in the morning then doze in bed for another fifteen or twenty minutes before it's time to insert my lenses. During this time, my eyes tear up a little from the medication. The tears, combined with drips of medicine, create crusts around my eyes that are irritating if I'm not careful about wiping them away. They often sting and I don't have time for that -- cats are calling for breakfast and I need my contact lenses on to see to feed them.<br /><br />These wipes are terrific for cleaning away excess eye drops on my skin and lashes. They're thorough and don't sting and the wipes are big so I can use one side to do most of the cleaning turn it over to make sure my lashes are completely clear.  There is no pain despite my dry eyes.<br /><br />I wish I'd found these sooner, and I'm glad to have them. They make my morning routine less stingy and crusty!",1

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B095C1WF44,4,2021-11-07 18:01:42.467,"Great razor, but no way to buy just replacement heads (at least not when I’m writing this)","First the good…<br />I love the razor! It’s cute and comfortable to hold. The razor has 5 blades that are stainless steel. It says they’re made of high quality steel in the USA. The razor head is magnetic so it just clicks right on, I was a little worried with it being magnetic that it might slide or move during use, but the magnets are strong and I wouldn’t even know they were attached magnetically has I not done it myself 😂 It has a metal handle that’s comfortable to hold. There’s a nice ceramic base for it to sit in when you’re not using it. The razor head moves nicely to conform to your body as you shave. It says it goes down 15 degrees and up 65 degrees (it says degrees Celsius in the image but that’s only for temp, not angles so not sure why they added the C? 😂). It has aloe on top AND bottom for extra protection and slip, which is nice. It said it came with 2 replacement razors, which I thought meant it came with the main one and then 2 additional ones, making 3, but it only comes with 2.<br /><br />Now for the bad…<br />They recommend to replace the blades every 2 months. But how?! There’s no replacement heads here on Amazon. Why sell something on here that requires replacement heads but not sell the replacement heads on here? Hopefully they will add them before I need them because I love the razor. The razor is currently $11.99. For that you get the razor handle part, ceramic stand, and 2 razor heads. So, if I replace the razor head every 2 months like they recommend, I’ll get 4 months of use out of this. Do I want to spend $11.99 every 4 months just to get replacement heads? That is $5.99 per replacement head if that’s all I’m buying it for. Then I also get a ceramic base every time that I won’t need since I’ll already have one and another razor handle, which I guess isn’t a big deal to replace over time. I can get 4 Venus Gillette replacement heads here on Amazon for $10.99. It’s basically the same thing but I can actually buy a replacement head for it.<br /><br />So, I’m not sure about this. I love the razor, but it isn’t anything crazy special. The Venus Gillette ones I usually use have aloe on them and 5 blades that work well. I don’t get the nice ceramic base for it to sit in, but that’s not a huge deal to me. I can at least replace the heads easily with it. So, it’s up to you if you don’t mind spending the $11.99 to get replacement heads for this and having to get the handle and base every time too. It’s a really nice razor that works well and is comfortable to hold, and it has a nice base to sit in. The only downside is the replacement heads. Like I said, hopefully they’ll add the replacement heads onto Amazon soon. Right now, I’d say it’s a great razor and if you don’t mind that you can’t buy replacement heads for it, I’d recommend it. If you do mind that you can’t get replacement heads for it, I’d still say it’s a great razor so maybe by the time you’re reading this they have added the replacement heads onto Amazon, so you can check and see! If they have, I’d recommend it. If not, I’d say skip them if it’s an issue not being able to buy just the replacement heads.",1

Your clothes change but you always take the same purse when you're out and about.  Your lipstick in that purse should go with everything you're wearing.

It’s hint of soft red is really gorgeous. It gives me supple lip looking vibes. Very seductive and alluring. As for the texture, I can say it does feel soft. I can’t compare it to others because I don’t really seek out this type.<br /><br />But, it spreads nicely and feels very soft on the lips, especially with a little layer of lip gloss, this just pops. But, it doesn’t have lasting wear as much as I’d hope. If you avoided eating, drinking, or even touching your lips, maybe it would stay longer, but it just doesn’t.<br /><br />It’s quite easy to rub off even after it sets to me. But, Top Tier Hazel is a gorgeous color, very bold and beautiful. It just doesn’t last without reapplication. And for colors like these, it’s very easy to notice smudges in your lipstick. Otherwise, not bad in the other areas. I still like it and will continue to wear it, But, They should really improve its lasting effect, though.<br /><br />P.S: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews. Thanks for reading🥰🥰",1

You do have to use soap and water to remove the powder well.  The spoolie and brush tool come in handy for adding a bit of powder where you want it, fine tuning, and the spoolie is a good size for combing and bushing to a nice finish.  I would love a taupe or blonde option for color because the brown is just not quite right. But, the shape and look of the brow is so good, I can tolerate the color. Also, maybe the darker color with blonde hair, is good!<br />This kit comes with a dark brown and light brown color, chestnut. The razor is cute but I still use  tweezers.<br /><br />5 stars",1

They aren't allowed to go to a real nail salon/spa yet so I planned an at home ""spa day"" for them, with their mom's approval of course. The foot spa uses batteries so I was able to do this anywhere and not have to worry about being close to an outlet. However, that could also be a ""negative"" as you have to worry about replacing batteries. We always have plenty of batteries at home anyway for our gadgets so it wasn't an issue. They had to ""wait in line"" for their turn while I painted their toes and gave them a stack of magazines to flip through. It was such a fun experience for them without having to spend a fortune, and in the safety of our home. The foot spa machine itself is pretty cool, and is almost like the one I have for myself. I did use warm water - the machine doesn't heat up or anything, so make sure you use lukewarm water for the little feets! I went a step further and even gave them an exfoliating foot scrub which is something I already have at home for myself. This is honestly the best $40 spent - an experience like this in a ""real"" salon and spa would have easily cost more than $40 for two girls. The great thing about this is that it is a suitable item for a wide range of ages, even after they've entered their teen years. I highly recommend this set.",1

AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,B0948NMZ1F,4,2021-11-20 02:19:44.203,Loved Two Movies!,"If you are looking for Harvest themed movies the first two in this collection are perfect. Harvest Love is about a woman who find herself again when she goes home for a vacation. The love story has the usual conflict at the start but the characters fall in love slowly and with a lot of restraint. No kissing until right at the end! Made me want to try pear desserts. Harvest Love is very innocent but has a little romantic dancing at a festival. I'd say it should be rated PG for this.<br /><br />Pumpkin Pie Wars was really cute and I loved that the women in the movie all ended up friends again in the end. Basically you have two best friends who have a falling out and it takes years for them to even speak to each other again. The happy ending in this can't be beat! Plus lots of baking competitions and romance. A little kissing but that is it.<br /><br />Truly Madly Sweetly made me feel uncomfortable for the most part because the characters were always in conflict. While the ending is happy I just felt like I would probably not watch it again. I don't mind when characters don't like each other at the start, but to be fighting for different goals basically the whole movie was not as enjoyable to watch. I also wondered what would really happen in their circumstance if the ex wife decided she wanted her husband back. It all felt a bit too risky for me.<br /><br />But no violence, swearing or anything objectionable in any of the movies. The G rating seems true for the last two of the movies at least. PG for Harvest Love.<br /><br />And I must admit my big strong husband came and sat right next to me while I was watching Harvest Love. These movies are enjoyable for men to watch too. Apparently. ;)))) He watched all three. But his question was...""Why are all these movies the same just with different actors?"" I told him they are just what women love to watch over and over again. It is the romance we crave. So we enjoy watching two characters fall in love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

When I saw that they were offering lipstick bullets now, I thought these would have that same effect. I was mistaken. This is a soft textured matte lip cream developed to attain the look of blurred lips, a popular Korean beauty trend. What exactly does ""blurred lips"" translate to in the West? It means skip the harsh lip liner & soften the edges of your lip borders. The goal is to achieve a gradual gradient of color.<br /><br />I got shade n°8 ""City Pop Chili"", which I would describe as a burnt brick red color. It feels very Autumnal and will be best complemented by those with warm skintones.<br /><br />The texture of the lip cream itself is soft & smooth, sorta like a mousse. It's very lightweight, easy to blend, and feels comfortable on the lips. It has a matte finish, with just the right amount of moisturizing properties to keep it from completely drying out my lips.<br /><br />I found that it's best to apply this product straight from the tube. I tried to build up opacity by using a lip brush to apply it, but every time I'd swipe the brush across my lips, it would actually remove product and leave bald spots. The formula isn't as long wearing as I was expecting from a matte lipstick, either. After a couple hours of eating, drinking, and expressive mouth movements, the color wears off entirely and I have to reapply. I really wish this wore down to a stain, but that's not what PeriPera was going for.<br /><br />The frosted, translucent pink lipstick component used for this line of lippies is understated, but pretty. It looks very feminine. The actual lipstick bullet has a slim silhouette and an angled tip. You get exactly one inch of visible product inside the tube. This formula is free of fragrance. There is no scent at all that I can detect.<br /><br />Expiration date printed on my product packaging is Aug. 2024<br />(2 years & 10 months from when I purchased it in Oct. 2021)<br /><br />Full Ingredients:<br />Dimethicone, Dibutyl Adipate, Microcrystalline Wax, Polyethylene, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Hydrogenated Poly(C6-14 Olefin), Polyglyceryl-2 Triisostearate, Ceresin, Iron Oxide Red, Pentaerythrityl Tetraethylhexanoate, Diisostearyl Malate, Bis-Behenyl/Isostearyl/Phytosteryl Dimer Dilinoleyl Dimer Dilinoleate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Silsesquioxane Crosspolymer, Plukenetia Volubilis Seed Oil, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract, Diglyceryl Sebacate/Isopalmitate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Silica, Polyglyceryl-2 Diisostearate, Stearalkonium Hectorite, Propylene Carbonate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Butylene Glycol, Water, BHT, Fragrance, Lithol Rubine BCA, Sunset Yellow FCF, Brilliant Blue FCF, Tartrazine",1

The gift box includes a reusable straw and a small brush for cleaning. A wine plug with a heart on top is thoughtfully provided too. Two nice size bath bombs alsopopulate the arrangement. A single wick scented candle is a nice size for a bathroom and it adds fragrance without being overpowering. A square rose soap wrapped in cellophane finishes the presentation. This all comes in a gift box with a pretty ""Best Wishes"" enclosure card with a blank inside to write a few words of your own. I like that the fragrance is not overpowering when the box is opened, as each scented item is unwrapped you can experience the pleasant aroma of the product.

I will have to use this cleanser exclusively in the shower.  I will say, there's a bit of confusion in the instructions.  It says to clean makeup around eyes but then it says to keep away from eyes?

I tried a prior one that was much bigger with supporting sides that ran halfway down my back, and found that it put me at an awkward angle in the tub that put way too much pressure on my tailbone and was extremely uncomfortable. I ordered this one to replace the other one, and I am thrilled with it. It's incredibly comfortable to rest my head against, and stays in place well using the two large suction cups on the back of it. I usually like to slide deeper into the tub about halfway through my bath, and this pillow is small enough and light enough that I can simply and easily readjust it to my new position, and it's still just as secure and just as comfortable after I've moved it. When I'm done bathing, it has a handy plastic hook attached that I can use to hang the bath pillow on the towel rack to dry. This pillow currently sells for $12.99, and I feel like it's a good value.",1

Nope from me.,"This is probably about the 100th brand I have tried for an eye mask if I exaggerate a bit.<br />I use under eye patches almost everyday, sometimes twice a day not only for under eye but also for my neck lines and forehead.<br />So I am not kidding when I say I have tried 10s of different brands of under eye patches from Amazon.<br />To be honest, under eye patches are for a rather temporary fix, in that you have to use them everyday or for a long period to have more permanent effects. But that’s how all skin care products work in my opinion. I use it to reduce very fine lines under my eyes (you can’t really see it unless you look in the mirror closely but it bugs me), and prevent my neck and forehead lines from getting worse (and hopefully to improve).<br />This one didn’t stay well at all on my neck, and I felt it dried out too quickly.<br />FYI, I don’t have dark circles, so my rate of effectiveness is solely for fine lines and such.<br />For my neck lines, I think most eye patches are at par in terms of quality, to be honest. Of course, from time to time, there are brands with quite inferior quality to others. I wouldn’t know about this one, as it kept falling off.<br />The last straw was that it just ripped apart when I tried to move the slipped mask back to the intended spot. It was annoying. After a couple of times, I just took it all off from my face.<br />The bottom line is that this product doesn’t have any price advantage to overlook its rather inferior quality compared to similar quality eye masks in this price range either.<br />I got so many other eye masks right now, I am not going to use this one unless I run out of eye masks between shipments or something (highly unlikely though).<br />Overall, 2.5/5 from me based on my experience of trying this mask for the very first time, and I won’t be recommending this.",0

To begin with, it arrived inside a clear bag with a silver tie, making me smile at the nice presentation. Being impressed with the packaging was nothing compared to the wonderful aroma that I was treated to when I peeked under the seal and looked at the product. It looked like whipped cream cheese and smelled good enough to eat! The scent is a combination of chocolate and mint. Taking just a tiny bit of the cream in my hands to feel it let me know why it is called velvet body cream. It truly does feel velvety, silky and soft.<br /><br />I was able to appreciate all of the above before I even tried the product. However, using the product is the real treat. This soft and silky cream is just fun to use. Getting out of the shower and dealing with dry skin in the winter is a pain and this product changes that. Instead of being in a hurry to get some lotion slathered on my skin so I can get dressed, I look forward to pampering myself with this product. I feels so good on my hands while I am applying it to my arms and legs. Of course it smells wonderful too but the really great part is how well it absorbs and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.<br /><br />If you are looking for a gift for a friend that complains of dry skin in the winter, look no further. Your gift will be appreciated!",1

The bottle is so soft that you have to really be careful with how you squeeze it. It easily splurts out blobs that are too much for just hand sanitizer.

The box is black trimmed in gold. On the cover there is a gold outline of a compact mirror. Inside that outline it says, ""Not a Day Over Fabulous."" Inside, there is a nice large white woven cosmetic bag (that of course could be used for lots of other things, too), a 4"" square jewelry plate, and a gold compact mirror. All say in flowing script, ""Beautiful girl you can do fabulous things."" The compact case has the same inscription on both the front and back cover, which is great. In its brand new state, the writing on the compact mirror doesn't show up well from a distance, but I think with use the engraved area will darken a bit and the writing will be better seen. The message is meant for the one holding the mirror, anyway, and not others nearby, so even if it doesn't darken, it still delivers inspiration where it's intended. The mirror quality is good. These items make a perfect gift set to give to a girl in age or a girl at heart, and I'm sure would be appreciated by either.",1

They’re soft, they work great, they clean well, they last pretty well, and they didn’t soak up too much of my foundation. So, they were a win for me. I’ve tried many other sponges, but never found ones I loved as much or more than my Real Techniques sponges…UNTIL NOW!<br /><br />Initially what caught my eye with this sponge was the shape. I loved it had a thin, pointed tip I could use for concealer and areas like around my nose. I loved the 2 angled sides so I can apply cream blush or bronzer or for when I want to apply powder. The sides would work great to apply my foundation. I was hoping the shape would work as well as it seemed like it would, and it did! I was a little worried about the size. Usually, I like to use those little mini sponges for under my eyes. I just never found a sponge, even with a pointy tip, that gets under my eyes to blend my concealer as well as the mini sponges do. So, I was hoping this would still work as a great all around sponge, and, like I said, it did!<br /><br />The sponge is AMAZING! It’s so soft, but dense so it doesn’t seem to absorb hardly any product. That makes it so easy to clean! I’m the kind of person that hates when my sponges have product stains on them. After I use them, I clean them and keep working at it until all the product is out of it and it looks new again. This can be hard on my sponges and cause them to tear after a few washes. My Real Techniques sponges held up well during my washings, but still would start tearing after about a month of regular washes. I LOVE that this sponge is dense enough that it doesn’t absorb hardly any product, so it’s easy to clean and I don’t have to scrub it for a while, but it’s still so soft and bouncy!<br /><br />It does get bigger when it’s wet, and it’s already a good size when dry. But, the point on it is thin enough that it gets under my eyes to blend my concealer the way I like it! I don’t have to switch to a mini sponge to do my concealer! I love that!<br /><br />The sides work great to apply my foundation. It blends it so easily and it looks so smooth and beautiful!<br /><br />The angled edges work great to apply cream blush/bronzer/contour. It blends them out great and doesn’t lift product underneath it!<br /><br />It works great to apply powder too!<br /><br />This is such a great sponge that does everything I need it to and I don’t need to switch to different sponges to do different things! This one sponge has enough different shapes that it does everything I need! I definitely recommend it!",1

AH3OJBOMJC4VDM7H3WPKDYMOXWNA,B099S51ZY6,4,2021-12-12 02:31:35.340,7 head shaver. Waterproof. The on/off button is easy to accidentally toggle when using,"First off, I'm going to review this for face/beard shaving. I don't have a bald head (yet, anyway), so that isn't my focus.<br /><br />I have used rotary floating blade shavers for decades (usually Norelco). They work best on my face, especially for the neck region. These shavers have always featured three heads.<br /><br />Well, here we have seven heads. Seven heads!! I have used very similar shavers to this one with five and six-head shaver attachments. This is one more. The question is: Why do the high-quality venerable brands stick to three heads, and these shavers use so many more?<br /><br />The answer isn't quality of shave. In fact, I was impressed at how well this shaver cleared the stubble on my face at the end of the day. It was comfortable, and managed to navigate the nooks and crannies of my face and neck as well as my low-end Norelco (if not better). But it's no match--not even remotely close--to my top-of-the-line Norelco (though that costs about 4x as much, so that's probably not a fair comparison). But--and this is huge--the ergonomics of the shaving heads leave something to desire. First off, there's very little reservoir under the cutting heads for shaved hair (see photos). This means you'll need/want to wash the head (it's water immersible) after each shave. Second, the middle head of the seven doesn't pop up. To remove it, you have to twist it off. It's a bit of a pain--and there's even less room under this head for hair than any of the others.<br /><br />The third issue I have with the cutting heads is that there's no obvious way to replace them without simply replacing the entire shaving head assembly. Based on my experience with other shavers quite similar to this, expect the blades to get dull after a bit of use, and factor in the cost of an entire replacement head unit when they do.<br /><br />In terms of seven vs six vs five heads? Well, the motors in these shavers are effectively the same. So if you have seven heads, the amount of power you provide to each head is less than it is in a five head design. That's going to affect the maximum speed and also the ability to easily tackle heavy stubble. Given that I don't sense a huge amount of improvement with seven vs five (or six) heads, I'd be inclined to veer towards fewer heads.<br /><br />In general, I'd suggest that you can interchange the 7/6/5 head assemblies if you want to get a replacement.<br /><br />In the kit you get:<br /><br />Seven head cordless shaver with LCD readout of charge remaining<br />Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />Nose hair trimmer attachment<br />Hair clipper attachment<br />Two face cleaning attachments<br />Three length guides for the hair clipper attachment<br />Charging cable (requires USB-A power source). The charge port on the shaver is a standard USB-C port.<br />Small cleaning brush<br /><br />Shave is controlled via a simple on/off button on the back. Given how you would normally hold this--palmed (see photo)--I found it annoyingly easy to accidentally push the power button when I was using it.<br /><br />The non-shaver attachments are a mixed bag. On the plus side, the nose hair trimmer works very well. This is in contrast with the nose hair trimmers that come with clippers, which are worthless. The nose hair clipper here works as well as the dedicated nose hair clippers I've used. On the minus side, the hair clipper is quite mediocre--it operates at a low speed and struggles with any amount of hair. It's about as good/useful as the clipper that's integrated into some shaver handles. Those can clip a bit of trim hair, but they are an exercise in frustration for any serious hair removal. Same here. The face cleaner attachments are probably OK, but I can't imagine using them.<br /><br />On the whole, I'd consider this a decent little kit useful for shaving your face and for nose hair removal. The remaining attachments are, in my opinion, not very useful. While it does a good job of shaving out of the box, my experience is that the heads get dull somewhat quickly, and you need to buy a not-inexpensive replacement assembly. Also, cleaning the assembly is a nuisance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />** 7 head shaver does a good job on face<br />** Waterproof (IPX level not indicated)<br />** Nose hair clipper works well<br />** Li-Ion battery: 2 hours charge for 90 minutes use<br />** Charge port on shaver is standard USB-C, so you can use charge cables you have at home<br />** Can lock the power button for travel (by holding for 3 seconds)<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Too easy to push the power button when palming the shaver in the hand during use<br />** Hair trimmer has limited usefulness<br />** Face cleaning attachments not very significant<br />** Shaver head assembly doesn't provide much room for hair and will need to be cleaned after each shave<br />** Middle head of shaver attachment difficult to remove for cleaning<br />** Must replace entire shaving head unit when one/more blades get dull<br />** 7th head in shaver assembly does not float like outer heads<br /><br />Note that there is a dizzying number of similar 5/6/7 head shavers sold on Amazon. As far as I can tell, having reviewed many of them, they are all made by a handful of companies and work pretty much equivalently well. The snap-in attachments even work across different models and brands. There are variances in features like level of waterproof and how the power switch works (and the body shape), but the function is pretty similar. So shop around for price.",1

I mostly need help on my cheeks this time of year, so that's where I've been using it.<br /><br />I spread this on my cheeks and it immediately leaves a slight cooling sensation. It takes a while for it to soak in/dry down completely and it feels a bit tacky until then. Once the tackiness is gone, my skin feels very soft to the touch, however, when looking in my makeup mirror, my skin doesn't look hydrated at all. It looks just like it did before using this moisturizer.<br /><br />I think this might be more suited to someone younger and with oilier skin.

I’m still at the point where I’m not sure if I can say it truly works because I need to use it for a longer period of time, but I’ll discuss various aspects about the product that will hopefully help with your decision-making.<br /><br />-Came well-packaged in a small, but sturdy cardboard box. Everything arrived intact. I have continued to use this box for storage of the product.<br />-Comes with the handheld laser device, charger with base to plug into an outlet, and manual<br />-No complaints about the battery life so far<br />-Simple to use: there are two buttons: The power button that turns the device on. Then you can press it to cycle through the various levels of intensity 1-5 which are clearly shown using green light bars. You can then hold the power button down to turn the device off again. The top button can be pressed to activate the laser after you have chosen the level of intensity you want.<br />-The laser only works if positioned correctly over an area of skin. It will give a single negative sounding beep if not positioned correctly, and a positive sounding double beep if it is positioned correctly as the laser works. You wait to move the device to the next area after you hear that second beep indicating that it is finished with that laser sequence<br />-The device has a white, plastic outer shell. It is lightweight while still feeling sturdy and durable. I would still be very careful not to drop this as I’m not sure how it could handle a fall<br />-I would recommend experimenting on the lower intensity settings. The undereye area is pretty sensitive. I feel I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but my eyes often still tear up after using per instructions on the highest settings of 4 and 5. For whatever reason, my left eye is much more sensitive to this.<br />-I don’t want to say it is truly painful, but I suppose the best way to describe the sensation is almost similar to if you were being stung by a rubber band that you pulled back and let hit your skin if that makes sense. It isn’t comfortable, but you do get more used to this and can work your way up to a higher level of intensity. You will probably also feel some warmth on the skin after using.<br />-I know this is marketed for under the eyes, but I have also been using on my forehead and by my smile lines.<br /><br />***The instruction manual is pretty clear and straightforward. You definitely need to read this before getting started. Here is some information that you can find within the manual:<br /><br />-They say all skin tones and anyone over the age of 12 can use NIRA to reduce the appearance of wrinkles around the eyes<br />-You need to clean and dry your face just prior to using NIRA<br />-It can be using morning or night and up to twice daily. They recommend waiting 1 minute before retreating each area and not to treat more than twice within a 1-hour period.<br />-Do not treat the same spot twice in a row, even if the pulse is rejected and you get the low pitched, negative sounding beep<br />-The instructions clearly show you the recommended way to treat the undereye area and the treatment pattern to use<br />-They recommend using the highest power level where you feel warmth without pain<br />-You should use a facial moisturizer after each treatment and a daily sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is recommended. This bundle includes the hyaluronic acid serum which can also be used.<br />-Device should be kept clean and free of dust, especially the glass lens which can be cleaned with a cotton swab. Surfaces can be cleaned with 70% alcohol solution between each use.<br />-They say some potential side effects include: skin warmth, redness, and stinging. Less frequent side effects include dryness, roughness, tanned appearance to skin, swelling, flaking, itching, crusting, bruising, pimple-like rash, irritated skin, blistering, scarring, infection, and skin color changes where your skin may become darker or lighter. I have only experienced the temporary warmth and stinging during use- no redness or anything else.<br />-The company also cautions those who have skin conditions or are undergoing professional cosmetic treatments such as injectable toxins like Botox or fillers- saying to check with your doctor or clinician prior to using NIRA.<br />-Only use on intact skin<br />-Don’t use if pregnant or nursing or undergoing fertility treatments<br />-Do not use if you have a history of skin cancer, any other cancer, or pre-malignant moles<br />-Do not treat if you have tanned skin which is apparently at increased risk of adverse effects with light-based devices<br /><br />Overall, I’m happy with how the product functions and the ease of use. I will continue using and will update if I have any further comments or concerns. I haven’t noticed any real results yet, but I also haven’t been using it that long. One question that comes to mind is this: What is the lifespan of this device? Months? Years? Or does it give out after firing the laser a certain number of times? I could have missed it in the manual, but that is something I’m still not sure of. For the current price of $329, that is something I think people may want to know. I haven’t had any issues with the serum that comes in this package, but it seems pretty simple and basic.",1

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B09LLKBZ3S,2,2021-12-22 23:53:14.460,HAS ACETONE!! Takes WAY longer than the 5-10 min they say!,"NOTE - It says this is for gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue. It is NOT FOR ACRYLIC NAILS OR POLY GEL!<br /><br />I do a lot gel polish and a lot of dip powder on my nails, so I always have to use acetone to remove the polish/dip powder. When I saw this was a gel polish remover kit that had a NON-acetone polish remover, I was really intrigued! I was even more intrigued when it said it “gently removes gel nail polish, glitter gel, dip powder, or nail glue from your nails without damaging within 5 mins, the gel polish remover even can remove the toughest polish quickly and effectively, recovering the original state of nature!” To say it removes gel polish and dip powder gently within 5 minutes is a HUGE claim for a NON-acetone polish remover. To say that it also removes glitter gel gently within 5 minutes is an ever BIGGER claim for a NON-acetone polish remover! Even when I use my 100% acetone to remove dip powder and glitter polish, it takes longer than 5 minutes! So, for this to be NON-acetone but say I removes gel polish, gel glitter, and dip powder gently within 5 minutes…I had to try it!<br /><br />Then, I got the product…It comes in a nice outer product box that is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in China. It does have an ingredient list, which is really short…”Alcohol, Acetone, Propylene Glycol, Essence, Deionized Water.” Yep, you see that right, ingredient #2 is….ACETONE! Exactly what they said this did NOT have in it! They are calling it a NON-acetone gel nail polish remover, yet the second ingredient is ACETONE!! After that I realized, the product name itself didn’t even say it was a NON-acetone polish remover. It was only in the product description that they said it didn’t have acetone in it. It said, “NON-ACETONE GEL NAIL POLISH REMOVER KIT: The gel nail polish remover, acetone-free remover liquid, is infused with premium formula.” Just a straight up LIE! 🤦‍♀️<br /><br />On top of that, they’re all over the place on how long you’re supposed to let this sit in your nails. First, they say quite a few times that it removes the product “within 5 minutes.” But, then in the product description when they get to the part of how to use it, they say “wait 5-8 minutes.” THEN, if you look at the product photos, the 6th photo has steps of how to use it. There it says to wait “8-10 minutes.” They just can’t decide!<br /><br />Normally, to remove my gel polish or dip powder, I would first file each nail a little to kind of break the seal. Then, I would take a little cotton round, dip it on my 100% acetone to soak it, place that on my nail, place a soak-off clip over it to hold it in place, and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes before it would even start to come off! If it’s glitter polish or glitter dip nail powder, it needs to sit even longer sometimes! So, for this gel polish remover to be NON-acetone and say it works within 5 minutes, I was really excited to see that! Of course, imagine my disappointment when I get it and see the ingredients on the back Includes ACETONE as the second ingredient in this “NON-acetone gel polish remover.”<br /><br />For use, it says to apply the polish remover to a cotton pad, put the cotton pad on the nail, clip it on with the soak-off clip, and then wait for 5-8 minutes, then remove it. I thought it was funny how it said it removes the product “within 5 minutes” quite a few times in the bullet points prior to the part where it tells you how to use the gel polish remover, but then when it gets to the part where it tells you how to use it, it says to “wait 5-8 minutes.” So, that means it works within 8 minutes. Saying it works “within 5 minutes” means that it will remove the product in 5 minutes or less. They should have said within 8 minutes if you’re supposed to wait 5-8 minutes. BUT, THEN, if you look at the product photos, there is one that shows the steps for how to use the gel polish remover. It’s the last photo before the video (6th photo). It says first file the nail surface. Second, soak the cotton pads in the nail remover. Third, cover nails with cotton pad folded in half. Fourth, and this is the important part, fix the nails with the nail clips and then remove the clips and pads “after 8-10 minutes.” Fifth, use the cuticle pusher to remove all the popped off polish.” So, first, they repeatedly said that this gel polish remover would remove product “within 5 minutes.” Then, it changed to “wait 5-8 minutes.” But, then, it says “8-10 minutes.” So, definitely seems to be some confusion there with what they wanted to put. Of course, removing the product “within 5 minutes” sounds a lot better than 5-8 minutes and waaaay better than 8-10 minutes. But, I’d rather a company just say what it is than try to sell it to me using some random numbers. But, even if it takes 10 minutes, it’s still faster than it takes when I use 100% acetone, so I was still really interested to see how this would work! Again, imagine my surprise when I got it and saw the second ingredient listed for this “NON-acetone gel polish remover” is ACETONE!!<br /><br />I liked how they included a little bottle to put the polish remover in and cotton pads, so you just need to put the cotton pad on the top and push down to get the remover onto the pad. It also includes 10 soak-off clips to use. It also includes a cuticle pusher, which can be used to scrape the polish off once it is ready, and a nail file. So, it includes everything you need to remove your gel polish/dip powder!<br /><br />Even though they totally lied about it being a NON-acetone polish remover, since I usually use 100% acetone on my nails, I figured I’d give it a try anyways.<br /><br />And another thing..since it has acetone in it, it has a STRONG odor like acetone nail polish remover have, which I also thought was funny because on the product page, if you scroll down to “Customer Questions & Answers,” someone asked if it had a strong smell. The SELLER responded with, “No, it does not. It is colourless and low odour.” Along with a strong odor, it isn’t colorless - it has a slight yellow kind of tint to it. Looking at the other questions and answers I saw someone else asked if the kit came with cotton pads and the SELLER answered, “Yes, I get cotton pads with my purchase.” What?! “With YOUR purchase,” you’re the seller! 🤦‍♀️ 😂<br /><br />Just ridiculous all around…<br /><br />As for the products in the kit…<br />The nail polish remover works just like nail polish removers work. It isn’t as strong as 100% acetone. It definitely takes longer to remove my gel polish and dip powders, especially the glitter polishes. It takes longer than the 15-20 minutes it takes with my 100% acetone. No where near the 5-10 minutes the product page says. It doesn’t even work better than my Sally Nail Polish remover, which has acetone as the 1st ingredient. It does work better than any of my ACTUALLY non-acetone nail polish removers, which won’t remove my gel polish or dip powders (or at least I’m not patient enough to wait to see how long it would take for them to remove it 😂).<br /><br />The clips work just like any other plastic soak-off clips I’ve used before.<br /><br />The cotton pads are little square pads that are stiff at first, but soften once the nail polish remover is applied. They work just like any other pads I’ve gotten before.<br /><br />The little nail polish remover push dispenser bottle works okay. It takes quite a few pumps to get any nail polish remover to come out, but it comes out eventually. I’m interested to see if the bottle holds up with the nail polish remover inside it given that there is acetone in it. I’ve had bottles like these before, kind of plastic type feeling bottles, and the acetone usually eats away at it and I have to remove it before it starts leaking. So, maybe this is made out of something that can handle it. Or, maybe since this isn’t 100% acetone, maybe it’ll handle it okay. But, I’ll be keeping my eye on it since the 2nd ingredient is acetone.<br /><br />Overall, I’d say, if you’re looking for a kit that has all this in it - soak-off clips, nail file, cuticle pusher, cotton pads, nail polish remover push dispenser bottle, and nail polish with acetone in it, this is a good kit. The price isn’t too bad given what you get and how large of a bottle of nail polish remover you get. But, if you’re looking for a NON-acetone nail polish remover - This is NOT it! This has acetone has the 2nd ingredient, so you’ll need to look elsewhere. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that is 100% acetone, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for nail polish remover that works quickly in 5-10 minutes like the product page says, this isn’t it. If you’re looking to buy from a brand that is honest in their description, this isn’t it. So, basically, I’d say, if you’re looking for a nail polish remover with acetone in it, that works like any other nail polish remover that has acetone in it but isn’t 100% acetone and that comes with everything else in this kit, then I’d say go for it.

It comes with several different flosser heads, which is great. I have very sensitive teeth, so I have to make sure I put in warm (almost hot) water, or it will have my teeth aching for hours! The pressure is very strong, even just on normal. I go between using Normal & Soft to get the job done. I think the design is fine, the flosser attachment rotates, however I just rotate the entire body in my hand. The rotating flosser seems pretty unnecessary. Overall, a decent flosser.",1

One set of 6 smaller bottles come in a clear plastic zip-lock cosmetic bag, and a second box of 4 larger bottles.  The set of 6 smaller bottles also comes with a glittery toe separator and kitty-shaped emory board.  The set of 4 larger bottles also comes with 50 nail stickers.<br /><br />These are the colors that you get:<br />Gold glitter (a small and a large bottle)<br />Baby blue (small and large bottle)<br />Baby pink (small and large bottle)<br />Violet (small and large bottle)<br /><br />Additional small bottles:<br />A slightly brighter baby pink<br />A deeper pink<br /><br />I took a photo to show you that the polish is the correct consistency and I applied it to my nails easily.  It dries quickly.  Since this is water-based nail polish meant for little girls, it wears off quickly.  And you can peel it off very easily. That way, you don’t need harsh nail polish remover to take it off.<br /><br />This is not really suitable as a single 10 piece gift set since the bottles come in two totally separate packages of 4+6, and since ALL of the 4 larger bottles duplicate with the same color that is included in the set of 6 smaller bottles.  It is better as two separate (but similar) gifts.<br /><br />I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases becasue I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.

I have used these twice now around the holidays when I've been worn out. These comma-shaped masks are easy enough to apply - there is a little spatula thing to help lift them out in order to be sanitary. They have a wet, silicone-like feel that is very similar to the feel of a contact lens, only thicker. I found that they stuck to my skin fairly well, even when I was moving around. The mask felt nice on and was a bit cooling after awhile. The area under my eyes felt refreshed after using these, although I didn't actually notice anything visibly different.

I am going to assume it is – but it should still say it clearly on it...<br /><br />It is black – so it is definitely “a look” for most people.  If you are goth or something – you will probably love it.  I got it mostly for Halloween.  Especially as it is matte – I can use it on my face as a whole to help with my costume– and not just on my lips.  It is easy to apply and actually applied VERY precisely.  If you wear it alone it is sort of dry on the lips – but not as dry as some others out there.  I like to add a slight layer of a balm first – just to give me some hydration.  It still comes off very matte that way but maybe doesn’t wear as well for longevity.  Even then – it didn’t come off on my teeth – just slightly on a cup I was drinking out of.  Not terrible at all though.  It has a slightly vanilla like scent to it.  It is pretty nice.

I've been using this conditioning bar for 2 weeks. For purposes of this review I have very long super fine and straight color treated hair. I've tried several bars as I'd like to cut down on household waste but usually my issue is the bar is too drying or if it's a cleansing bar doesn't clean well enough. It has not been the case for this BOB bar- though it takes some effort (I've been dragging the bar directly on my hair in order to get it to condition my hair) this bar actually conditions really well (leave on 2 minutes after application and rinse). I typically allow my hair to air dry overnight as I sleep and my hair is still pretty damp in the morning compared to when I've used other conditioners which tells me the bar is trapping moisture in my hair. I don't have an static issues later (an indicator that my hair is dry). The bar doesn't really have much of a smell (maybe just a light fresh scent) and doesn't linger. I've not made hardly a dent in this bar since I started using so I anticipate it lasting a while- seems a good value so far and works well!,1

I chose this one because it really seemed like the whole kit. And it is. I was able to open this box and use it right away. Everything from tools to the remover is included. The 16 ounces of remover is a generous amount and should last me a while.<br /><br />I am pleased with how the remover works and the entire kit has made taking off my gel polish very easy.,1

The bar is about the size of a small mandarin orange. It lather ups my hair pretty well and has a slight rosemary scent to it. I’ll lather, rinse, repeat and go in with a silicone head massager. I’ll follow with my own conditioner. I’ll wash off the excess foam and place the bar back onto the paper it came in. I did notice that the shampoo did slight fade my purplish hair and made it look a bit brassy so I won’t use this too long often.

My girls are 6 and 8 and they like to relax and have spa days as well as play nail salon where they give mom and dad a relaxing time. This foot soak is great for all that. The bubbler and music work great although I do wish there was volume to turn down the music. It's easy to use for they to do on their own if they wish. I to think over all the accessories for it are geared to older kids because the stick on nails were too big for my 8 year old. The toe dividers and flip flops are huge and seem more sized for adults. The nail polish is quick dry which is great for kids who are impatient and file works fine.,1

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B08PHS33D9,4,2022-01-22 16:30:44.192,Great 1st step in my 2 step cleanse!,"This comes in a nice outer product box. It is made in Korea. The writing on the box and jar is in Korean, except for a part saying to use these on the face.<br /><br />These come with little plastic tweezers to use to pick up the pad. There is no where to store them when you’re not using them! I thought I could just sit them inside the tub on top of the wipes to keep them where I wouldn’t lose them, but they don’t fit. It would be nice if they would have put something on the tub where you can attach them to keep them from being lost. I feel like they will easily get lost! On top of that, I feel like they’re more of a pain for me than a help. I need to try to get in there with them and separate the top wipe from the rest, then pick it up. I might just not be coordinated enough for them 😂<br /><br />The product page says the pads are made of 100% pure cotton material. They are hypoallergenic, made with all natural ingredients to prevent burning sensations, stinging, itching, swelling, and redness. They keep skin hydrated. They contain 1000ppm of eggplant extract, extract from Centella Asiatica, Salvia Hispanica Seed, Houttuynia Cordata and Birch Sap to naturally hydrate and protect skin. They also contain lupeol, anthocyanin, polyphenol, vitamin C, and choline. Of course, I have no way of knowing if any of that is true since I can’t read any of the info on the box or tub since they didn’t put the info in English and didn’t provide a full ingredient list on the product page.<br /><br />For use, according to the product page (since, again, they couldn’t be bothered to provide info in English on the box or tub), use the wipe to remove makeup then rinse off face with water. I’ve used wipes like these before, some of them leave the skin feeling pretty oily or like there’s a lot of residue left, which can make you want to wash your face after using it. Others don’t, which can make you feel like you don’t need to wash your face after. Really, it comes down to the wipes - how well they wipe the makeup off, what’s left on the skin, etc. - and personal preference on if you prefer to rinse your face off after, wash your face after, or just leave it.<br /><br />For me, I always do a 2 step cleanse. I always used an oil cleanser as my first step in my two step cleansing. I love oil cleansing pads so that it was all in one - rather than putting some cleansing oil on a pad, the oil is already on these pads. I like these pads. Some wipes aren’t wet enough so you feel like you really need to scrub at your face. I don’t like makeup wipes for removing my makeup because I feel like they’re too harsh on my skin. There are some that are wet enough they wipe the makeup off pretty well, but they still feel harsh. I find oil cleansing pads feel gentler on my skin. These are soaked in enough oil where they gently wipe makeup off. They even remove my stubborn mascara and waterproof liner. But, I don’t feel like my skin is truly cleansed after using them. I like they get most of it off, then I go in with my facial cleanser to get the rest off. If you wear a full face of makeup and wanted to skip that step, I feel like you’d need to use at least 2 of these to really get all the makeup off, and I still feel like you’d definitely need to at least rinse your face after to remove any leftover makeup residue.<br /><br />A lot of time wipes like these will break apart as you’re using them. These didn’t break apart at all while I was using them, so I was happy about that!<br /><br />Like I said before, if you wear a full face of makeup and don’t want to do a 2 step cleanse, you’ll probably need to use at least 2 of these to really get all the makeup off. I find that trying to use 1, it just gets too much makeup on it and kind of just starts spreading oily makeup residue all over your face. If you use just 1, you can wipe the majority of your full face of makeup off and then rinse your face and go in with your second cleanser. That works well. If you don’t want to go in with a second cleanser, I found the best way is using one to get the majority of the makeup off, then once it’s covered in makeup get a new one and wipe your face again. You’ll see on that second one there’s still a ton of product that gets on it..at least for me. Then, you can rinse off your face and be done. I would say it really depends on how much makeup you wear. On no makeup makeup days where I’m not wearing much makeup at all, I can easily use just 1 of these and rinse my face off and I would feel like my skin was clean (although I still always go in with my facial cleanser because I get hormonal breakouts and doing that second step helps keep those at bay!). When I do a full face with full coverage foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, etc., I don’t feel like just 1 of these is enough. I need to go in with 2, rinse my face off, then go in with my facial cleanser to feel like I got my face completely clean.<br /><br />For a while I used cotton rounds. I’d put my cleansing oil on my face, rub it around to kind of melt my makeup, add a little water by rubbing that on my face, then take a cotton round and wipe it off. That worked well. Then, I started using reusable cotton rounds. I like those because I can use just one and rinse it if it gets too much on it, rather than having to get another one if it was a disposable cotton round. Yes, I have to wash them, but they work better and save me money in the long run since I’m not going through disposable cotton rounds like crazy! I do find these to be easier since I don’t need to wash them. I feel like these are a lot gentler on my skin than my reusable cotton rounds are. Reusable cotton rounds always kind of just feel like a small wash cloth, which can be harsh on the skin. So, I do prefer these.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these! They feel gentle on the skin. They are soaked in enough oil where they gently and easily wipe makeup off, even stubborn makeup. Even though I need to use 2, I still really like them! You get 60 pads for $19.99 (at the time of writing this review). I don’t think that’s too bad compared to other cleansing oil pads I’ve tried. These work really well compared to others I’ve tried. They don’t break apart when using them. Even using 2 each time, I still feel like they are a good value for me. They save me time compared to using reusable cotton rounds since I don’t need to wash them. They feel gentler on my skin than my reusable cotton rounds. And, when I use my reusable cotton rounds, I still need to rinse them off while using them to remove my full face of makeup, so to me that’s the same as needing to use a second one of these. They have a slight fragrance but it isn’t anything unpleasant or overwhelming. I would have liked them to include the ingredient list in English on the product box and/or tub. I also would have liked them to include somewhere to place the tweezers so they don’t need to be loose outside the tub where they’ll easily get misplaced and lost forever! But, the pads work great and I definitely recommend them!",1

The shampoo bar is packaged in an environmentally beneficial way, with a recyclable cardboard box just large enough to contain the soap and its paper wrapping. It is plastic free, vegan, cruelty free, and it uses natural ingredients. The ingredients include green clay, lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint. I truly enjoy the scents of lemongrass, rosemary, and peppermint, so I didn't give the green clay part any thought at all prior to ordering this bar. Unfortunately, the scent of the green clay overwhelms the other scents enormously, and I don't find the wet clay smell enjoyable at all. The soap lathers and cleans well, and rinses out nicely. However, I don't want to wash my hair with something that smells unpleasant to me, especially since there are so many competing shampoo bars that smell wonderful and are just as environmentally friendly.",0

It does seem to have more blue undertones than some I've tried. However, based on the picture of 3 stacked lips that appears in the item description, I was looking for a result similar to the center one (or top one if you are looking at the lower photo that appears above the reviews), especially given that my skin color is close to the skin of that model, but on me, the color looks more like it does in the bottom photo, with a slightly more orange-y hue.

They are moisturized, but not really wet and gooey like some other patches we've tried. My wife and daughter found them very easy to apply under their eyes. The patches are shaped so that they naturally follow the curves under your eyes. They come to a point at one end, which fits quite nicely right up near your tear duct. A gentle press gets them set.<br /><br />When done using them, my wife and daughter both report feeling a refreshed, smooth sensation right where the patches were used. The effect is good, but not quite as good as some other patches. This seems to be because these masks don't hold on as long as other masks. After about 10 - 15 minutes, they start to peel away. Other masks hold on much longer, so have more time to work.<br /><br />Overall, these masks are comfortable and easy to use, but a bit less effective than some other ones. Still, I recommend them.",1

The material is the usual you’d get for a curler wrapped in silk. It’s all bendy and what you do is sort of braid your hair onto/with this. After that, you use the included scrunchies to hold it in place at the bottom.<br /><br />This sounds all well and good but, maybe it was just me, it was difficult to get my hair twisted correctly onto the rod. My hair is long, reaching about mid back and perfectly straight. If you get it on there right, it comes out looking very nice. It just takes a whole lot of practice. Also, as a side note, if your hair is a little damp, it works better.<br /><br />This comes with the main curler, two large scrunchies, two smaller scrunchies, two hair clips, and a nice bag to keep everything in. The scrunchies are silk.<br /><br />This works nicely and it’s worth trying out if you want heatless curls.

The shape of the tube and the shape of the lipstick itself harkens to another era. Perfect for making the ultimate Cupid's bow pout. It even has that slight fragrance that will remind you of vintage lipsticks.<br /><br />I normally wear red that has a little more blue in it, so was surprised that this clear red was fine for me. To me that says that it will flatter a wide range of skin tones.<br />After swiping it on my wrist and then wiping it away, it left a nice stain. If you aren't interested in that drop dead gorgeous look and want something a little more subtle, it does double duty by leaving a pinky red stain when blotted. But go for the high voltage dramatic red if you want to be noticed.<br /><br />Very comfortable lipstick, but I didn't have a problem with it bleeding. Non-drying and non-cracking. Opaque coverage with one swipe.<br />Another plus, it makes your teeth look super white.<br />I hope that this review as well as the photographs can help you to make a decision about this lipstick. It's really hard buying such things online, especially when it comes to luxury brands like this.",1

There's something about the vintage aesthetic that they capture so perfectly that always draws me in. I wasn't sure what I would think about their actual lipsticks however because of the bullet style is so unusual, but I really love this. The formula is creamy but long-lasting and even leaves a little bit of a stain, and the color is just the perfect red in my opinion it's a slightly deeper red so it feels a little more sophisticated and a little more wearable than a brighter red. It also has a slight blue base to it which makes your teeth look a little wider. The packaging is absolutely lovely and I actually find that I really enjoy the style of the lipstick bullet. I still always wear a lip liner of course but the angle of this makes it really easy to fully coat your lips. I will absolutely be buying more lipsticks from this brand.",1

Effective curling function. 👍👍,"Of course the first thing that the significant other noticed about the product is the pink coloring. She said it goes perfectly with her other hair/beauty products.  So, already it has a head start.<br />It comes inside a nice, somewhat snug drawstring bag. This is useful for transporting the curling device. And, yes, the compact size makes it very sensible to pack for remote (away from home) usage.  Another key aspect of the product is wireless operation. Evidence: she comments that not having to worry about wires or being close to the wall outlet is fantastic. And, not dealing with power cords means better time efficiency.<br />Operation is fairly easy. A long press of the power button turns it on. When you press the power button again, you advance to a feature you can alter/select, with that aspect blinking. For example, the ""R"" might be blinking. You use the +/- button to change it to ""L"" (R and L indicate the curling direction, creating right or left curls). In this manner, you can change the direction, temperature and timer.  The display also shows the battery power status.  When the curler device has reached proper temperature, it beeps. You can then insert a small section of hair. Curling appearance/tightness will depend on hair texture, temperature and time of treatment.<br />The battery capacity is rated at 5000mAh. It takes 3 - 4 hours to fully charge a depleted battery. This affords 4 - 6 hours of continuous operating time.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the wireless hair curling device, with a ruler for size reference. Close ups of the display, with varying settings, is provided to some of the selection options.<br />The significant other gives it two thumbs up with a smile.  👍👍  😄  Accordingly, it earns a 4.5+ star rating, with a very high level recommendation.",1

Thin hair makes it difficult to curl my hair because either they are too hot, to large, hair gets caught in clips, or other reasons.  As a result, I don't curl my hair often.  This might change that.<br /><br />CHARGING<br />Charging this took 3 hours once I got it.  It has a gauge on it which lets you know when the battery is full and status of it.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL<br />The control panel is covered in the instructions, but it is not quite what it is described.  I found it very intuitive, however and no problem in using it.  Just mess with the buttons and you will figure it out.  The right button changes the section, the left button chooses the level.<br /><br />SETTING<br />Every time I turn this off, I have to reset it to F instead of C and then I have to reset the different times too.  It does not remember so far every time I have used it and I have tried multiple ways.<br /><br />CURLING<br />This thing is AWESOME.  The thing is you have to have SMALL pieces of hair and make sure no other hairs are caught with it.  If you don't then it will curl your hair tight and jam it up.  More on that later.  I set my hair for baby fine at 300F and 8 seconds and once it heated up, the curls were perfect.  I had to redo a few of them but for the most part they were nice.<br /><br />JAM<br />When you are not careful to separate ALL hair from a section, sometimes the shorter hairs will catch in the roller in the opposite direction and it will cause a jam.  It is scary.  That is one reason why I set it only at 8 seconds.  All you do is make sure you have a mirror and then hit the controls until you reverse the direction and run it for a moment and VOILA- hair is out.<br /><br />Make sure to comb the hair and then redo it in smaller sections.<br /><br />TIMER<br />One more thing, this will roll up your hair and then it will beep each second of the count down of your hair in the roller.  It gives a long beep when done, you release the button and your hair comes out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a great curling iron.  I love that I can do this in the living room with a mirror and not have to stand in the bathroom.  My hair looks natural and beautiful.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS I wish this would set itself to Farenheit and stay there.  It is annoying to reset it every time.  I know it is supposed to stay, but mine doesn't.  Other than that, this would get five stars, but I am taking one off for that.<br /><br />PHOTO<br />I posted a photo of my hair so you can see how curly it is.  Keep in mind, I have very little hair and it is very very fine.  This curling iron really make my hair look amazing.",1

It leaves your skin feeling incredibly clean and soft.

Inside it is just a jar, no outer product box. But, there is plastic sealing around the jar. When you remove the lid, there is no seal there. It is made in the US. The ingredients are listed on the label.<br /><br />The product itself is a creamy yellow color. It has a slight scent to it, but I can’t quite place it, but it isn’t a bad or unpleasant smell, and I only smell it if I stick my nose right up to the jar. I don’t smell it while applying it. It has a gel like texture. It glides onto the skin. It feels extremely hydrating while applying it. Like your skin is going to be really hydrated. But, once it dries down it doesn’t have that feeling, it has a slight tacky feeling that takes a few minutes to go away. It does make the skin feel smooth and slightly hydrated but not as hydrating as I’d like. But, I didn’t get this to be my main face moisturizer. I got it for its brightening effects. So far I haven’t noticed any brightening, but something like this will take time.<br /><br />Right now I can say that it’s not very moisturizing. It doesn’t feel drying, but doesn’t feel moisturizing once it absorbs either. I haven’t noticed any brightening effects, but I’m going to continue using it and hopefully will notice some after continued use. It does work well under my moisturizer and makeup. Right now I only feel comfortable giving it a middle 3 stars since I can’t really speak to its effects and don’t find it moisturizing.",0

The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the White Blossom and the Lavanda scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. Once I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive ""Cologne"" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this ""Baby Cologne"" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",0

I decided to give this a try because I was curious about the scent and the execution of a product like this.<br /><br />First thing I did was smell this, and while it is a pleasant smell, this particular scent isn't my favorite. It is too floral for me, almost artificial. I may have liked and felt more comfortable using a citrus and fruity type of scent on my little one. I also looked at the ingredients list and while they may be free of parabens, phthalates, synthetic colors, dyes, GMOs, and Gluten Free, there are some potentially irritating ingredients for the very sensitive of skins. Ingredients like Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene can be an allergen. It may have prebiotics which is good but one good ingredient does not negate a potentially irritating one. I'm all for someone coming up with a safe and good cologne for baby but I'm not entirely sold on this product just yet. I did read up on some additional information but I need more convincing for me to be on board with this perfume for infants. I do love the story of why the founder wanted to create these scents for little ones but I'm just not fully on board with some of the ingredients used.<br /><br />I'm not sure I will be using this on my baby but I think a more appropriate age is pre-teen or teens. I may have been a little more open to a ""cleaner"" perfume for that age range as I'm sure there's a market for that. From what I read, the founder is going to be launching perfumes for that age group, so that might be more appropriate.<br /><br />My baby actually smells nice from good hygiene so he doesn't need anything else but I understand the concept behind these scents. Fragrances do invoke certain memories, just like music. There are certain scents that I get a whiff of and it immediately transports me back to that day, the person, or the memories of that particular time period. All that said, I will be holding off using perfume on my baby and will be spritzing this stuff on myself. I think the concept is great but I would like to see even ""better"" and cleaner ingredients if I am to use it on my baby.<br /><br />I didn't see the ingredients list posted on this Amazon page yet so here it is:<br />Ingredients:<br />Alcohol Denat., Aqua (Water), Parfum (Fragrance) Niacinamide, Glycerin, Lactitol, Xylitol, Linalool, Citral, Citranellol, Limonene, Hexyl Cinnamal, Gernaniol, Amyl Cinnamal, Limolene, Hydroxycitronellal.",0

Not because I think it is a good idea for a baby, because boy, is it not. I actually thought it would be perfect for myself since I don't like loud fragrances. The description of the scent profile really enticed me, as I love all of the notes. I was able to try both the Lavanda and the White Blossom scents.<br />Both of the ""Cologne"" sprays smell identical to me. I can't say that I can tell them apart at all. They both have a very strong earthy, herbal, slightly floral scent that is heavily ladened with alcohol upon spraying. It stays very strong for several minutes, but then starts to dry down.<br />Sadly, once it dries down, the scent pretty much dissipates. If I don't spray it heavily at first, which is too much for my asthma to handle, much less any baby, the scent just goes away completely. I must spray it on me again. If I spray it on a few times over an hour or so, I can smell the ever so slightest hint of it on my clothing later, if I put my nose right on it. That is a lot of spraying for very little payoff.<br />I know this is meant for kids mostly, but I would think the scent would and should last longer. Sure, my grandsons will like using it, maybe or not, as it is quite strong at first. But, I think it would just be more for the fun of it and very short lived. This is also very expensive ""Cologne"" to not be able to smell it after 30 minutes, and right at $28 is too expensive for me to buy just for the fun of it.  <br />For others this ""Baby Cologne"" may be something wonderful or maybe they can smell it more than I can. As I said, I really love the idea of a light fragrance, but not for babies. I do wish the scent stuck around more for me.",0

I didn't do any additional research on that so take it with a grain of salt, but if they do, that's a wonderful cause!<br /><br />I did more research and a lot of people seem to love these and switched to these from the pricey $20 a piece brand. This is so much more affordable and reasonably priced, not to mention it works great. I highly recommend giving these a try as many other people have raved about these as well. If you don't like it after trying, you've still only spent half the amount of what the famous brand costs - my point is, you really don't have anything to lose!

Which is impossible for me anyway, with my layered curly thinning hair. In fact the only way for to achieve a smooth head of hair is to use a flatiron and a ton of product, and i just don’t do that. It looks unnatural on me. I like these for the ability to look casual and unstructured. When i had longer thicker hair,i used the original invisibobble spirals, which were a game changer.

It is made in Korea. The product page says it is cruelty free and vegan, but I didn’t see any kind of certified logo saying it was on the product box. It is free of parabens, sulfates, gluten, and “other harsh chemicals.”<br /><br />This is a dual ended liquid liner. One end has a felt tip and one end has a brush tip. The caps are labeled, which is great! I don’t have to pull off the tops every time to figure out which end is which! Of course, since the labels are on the CAPS, you have to make sure not to mix them up. I don’t see myself having an issue with that since I don’t ever see a reason I’d take off both ends at the same time. But, if you do, you definitely want to make sure to put the correct cap on the correct side so you don’t mix them up. It probably would have been better for them to put the label on the center part rather than the caps, but it’s fine as long as you don’t take both ends off at the same time or just make sure to put the right caps back on.<br /><br />Both ends work really well. They glide on easily without skipping or bleeding. They are a pigmented black, not thin or watery black. They dry down quickly and stay in place throughout the day without smudging or coming off. I have really small, really hooded eyes, so having a dual ended eyeliner pen is great! I have the brush tip to get the thin tightline I want on my upper lash line, then I have the thicker felt tip to do my little wing when I want to. Both work great.<br /><br />When I first saw it was priced at $28.50, I thought that was pretty darn pricey for an eyeliner. But, it is dual ended, so you’re getting 2 eyeliners in 1 pen. Looking at it that way, it’s $14.25 a pen. I usually spend somewhere around $8-10 on my usual ones at the drugstore, so $14.25 isn’t the cheapest, but it isn’t too bad either. Personally, I love it being dual ended, but not enough to spend more than I spend on my usual liquid liners. My usual one at the drugstore ones are $10 (NYX Epic Wear Liquid Liner) and $8 (Maybelline Curvitude Angled Liquid Liner) and I never have any issues with them. So, I don’t see myself spending $28.50, even if I’m getting 2 for 1 because that’s still $14.25 each, which is more than I usually spend on my liquid liners. If price isn’t an issue for you, this is a really good liquid liner. Both ends work great and it’s a nice formula. I give it 4 stars.",1

This one still stands out as excellent in quality plus improvements with lash fullness, lash length, lash life cycle, and superb results overall along with ease of application. This is also one of two that were most expensive. While cost can sometimes dictate quality, this product definitely falls into that category. You are getting what you pay for with this one, AND the tube is generously sized so there is a good value as well. Anyhow, thought I'd update my review to compare the many products I've tested in the eyelash serum lines. Especially the most expensive ones.",1
AHSYS7DOWAOLGVZ7ENICI4ZNK36Q,B09NVT7GGD,5,2022-03-09 01:01:16.522,Super Easy To Clean!,"This is the perfect brush to add to your pet grooming arsenal.<br /><br />I use this brush as an indoor brush, I have another that cuts and lifts loose hair for outdoors.  This brush is nice because of the trigger that easily releases all the pet hair.  It is so convenient!  It's a real cure design too.  I was initially worried that the antennae on top would easily break off but the are made of a flexible rubber.  The bristles are made of a durable metal with a white coating on the tips so they're not so sharp.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great first pet brush, or a great addition to the supplies you already have.  You can never have too many brushes.  I recommend this to all the pet lovers out there.",1

It has a plastic top, and silicone bristles.  My dog loved it right away but the cats were a different story.  One cat loved this brush right away, had no problems at all.  My other cat was really unsure about it and even after letting her smell it, she wanted no part of it.  I had to sneak it when she was sleeping and then she warmed up to it.  Now they all love it.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this brush.  It brushes the animals nicely and they love the massaging bristles.",1

I have used a few over the years and by far this is my favorite so far! I love how sleek and easy to hold it is. It's not a big and bulky unit that feels awkward. It's almost like holding a shaver for your legs. This IPL has an integrated skin tone sensor that scans your skin before every flash and automatically selects the most powerful treatment for your skintone. It also has 3 comfort modes, and an attachment for more precise areas of hair removal such as your lip area or T zone. The attachment really gives you a lot of freedom to get closer to areas you wouldn't normally be able to without worrying about zapping hair that you wanted to keep. I love that! I'm loving the results I'm seeing after just using this for a short period of time. Hair be gone! Hopefully I'll only need to use this as a touchup once every 4 weeks once I reach the results I'm happy with. I'm seeing less hair regrowth already! Definitely a wonderful IPL device!",1

It’s super sleek, with the power to match and makes permanent hair eradication a breeze. It offers me a true painless treatment, as it also pampers my skin with its gentle touch.<br /><br />It also gives me 3 modes of supple comfort, and a sensor scanning process that proves it’s a true genius at loving my skin tone with integrated perfection. And I am literally addicted to the precision head it comes with, which is perfectly designed to help me focus on specific trouble spots or places I wish to give special detail to.<br /><br />Not only that, it allows me to truly spoil my skin with a picture of ‘hairless perfection’ in the span of a three song playlist.

This one is a little chunkier than most and feels rougher on my skin. It is also quite oily. I like some oil in my scrubs for moisturizing, often I don’t even need to apply lotion after using, but this one seemed extra oily and left the shower slippery. It separates, so needs to be shaken or stirred before using. It does leave my skin feeling smooth and provided you like coconut, the scent is nice.",1

It smells like chocolate, so I like the scent. The product is fairly thick with lots of gritty stuff in it for exfoliation, though I found I needed to mix it up with my finger before using it since it had separated a bit. It's definitely messy, so I'm glad I chose to use it in the shower. I initially liked using the scrub and how it felt, but then I had issues rinsing it off. No matter how much I tried to rinse, there was a dark film on my skin, which was very noticeable on my fair skin. Even scrubbing with a washcloth didn't help. I ended up needing to use soap to get the product off, which seemed frustrating because I had already washed before using the scrub, since the directions indicated my skin should be freshly cleansed before using it. I think in the future I will use the scrub, then get washed so that I don't end up with the dark film on my skin. It seemed like such an expensive product shouldn't leave me looking dirtier than I was before I got into the shower! In good news, my skin can be sensitive to some products, and this scrub didn't bother me at all.",0

I love the sponges as they are of medium-density.<br /><br />The flat / angled side is great for smooth applications. They feel good in my hands, blend well, and feel soft against my skin. Since these are of medium density, they do not soak up as much foundation as others that are more airy. I also love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.<br /><br />These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. These would have been perfect as gifts for the Easter Basket or as a stocking stuffer because each comes in their own package EXCEPT for the negative issue I mention below.<br /><br />There is one big negative, however. Each package is marked with a price of $1.55 each. Unfortunately, at the current price of $9.95, it comes to $1.99 per sponge which is $.44 cents more than the price marked. Therefore, I cannot recommend these if they are being used for resale or as stocking stuffers or Easter basket gifts because the price is actually more than it says on the package.",0

AFLOFC2VEB5BPAKOX2YLRARJHCXQ,B09NCDK9T1,5,2022-03-13 20:53:17.970,Impressive,"Wow this SmoothSkin Pure FIT Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser is impressive! I’ve had and used IPL lasers in the past but literally none of them were this fast.<br /><br />This thing is so simple and easy to use; read the booklet, follow the instructions, but all you have to do is plug it in and use it. It’s not complicated it’s actually very easy and simple to use.<br /><br />You do have to start with a shaved clean skin and then all you have to do is press and hold the button and in speed mode it will continuously flash as long as you move it along the skin. I have found that IPL laser results are effective and long lasting as long as you use this right. Go by the skin tone graph and use it weekly, unless skin irritation  develops.<br /><br />I absolutely love this thing. I like the little cap that it comes with for precision treatment areas such as the face. The cap Is actually magnetic so it stays on very well. My only gripe with this is that for this price, and this was priced at $379 at the time of purchase, you should get a case with this product, but you do not get any protective case just a box that it ships in, that’s kind of disappointing to me but it’s not a dealbreaker because this product produces excellent results. I would highly highly highly recommend this IPL laser in particular just because of the speed and effectiveness of it. I have pretty sensitive skin and after use I did not have any irritation with it. I used it on my face, under arms, bikini area and legs. I could not believe how fast it was and how easy it was to use!",1
AEC6IZVI2NGFBCIYVD4X5MDGB6DQ_1,B09NCDK9T1,5,2022-03-13 23:07:27.411,Great for Legs and Underarms,"I ordered this for my wife, and she is thrilled to have it so that she can be ready when shorts and swimsuit season arrives. Not having to shave every day will be an absolute blessing for her. This SmoothSkin Pure Fit Intelligent Ultrafast IPL Laser Hair removal device comes with the device itself, a power cord, an optional precision head for use on smaller areas, and a detailed instruction book. Since this device does not work if the skin is too dark or the hair is too light, it is important to check the online skin suitability chart before purchasing to make sure that this device will actually work for the user. My wife's skin and hair color fell within the effective range, so she was good to go when this arrived. Also, since this device can make the skin photosensitive during the course of treatment, winter is the best time to start the initial 12 week course of hair removal. For those who live in a place where there really isn't much of a winter, just be aware that skin needs to be protected from the sun during this treatment period. Since my wife is still in the early phases of this treatment and it's already mid-March, she'll be cutting it kind of close. Worse case scenario, though, she can at least get a month or so of treatments done and then resume and/or start her treatment over again when winter is back. This SmoothSkin device has two modes for treatments, Glide, which is just like it sounds and is a continuous firing as the device glides along the skin in a steady movement, or Stamp, which is a single controlled burst at a time, designed for areas where you want tighter control over when and where the light fires, such as on the upper lip. There are also three treatment intensities, Power, which is the highest setting and good for larger areas, Gentle, for sensitive areas (also recommended when first starting IPL and getting used to how it feels), and Speed, the fastest treatment mode, for quickly covering larger areas and for doing fast touch-ups. This sounds complicated, but after my wife began doing these treatments once a week, she found that it was actually fairly easy to do. Granted, she is just doing legs and underarms for now, which are fairly basic. My wife's initial opinion of this SmoothSkin Pure Fit IPL laser hair removal device is extremely positive. It's easy to learn, easy to do, can be done in the privacy of our own home and at a time that is convenient for her, and is far cheaper than having either IPL or laser hair removal treatments done in a shop. Not only that, but so far it's working.",1

They're fairly large for my wife's face (she's the one who got them), and they don't stay on quite as well as she'd like for outdoor activities such as running. In fact, she's used them in the winter months, when the weather where we live is mild to cold. In the summer when it gets hot, they're even less likely to stay in place.
