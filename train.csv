AGZZXSMMS4WRHHJRBUJZI4FZDHKQ,B000068PBJ,5,2005-08-09 12:12:58.000,The best razor ever!,"I had a Norelco years ago, then I went through three Brauns (the micro-foil ones that a straight instead of having three circular blades like this one).  All my razors were expensive, they were all the best in the bunch.  This is the best by far.<br /><br />This razor shaves close, I have never felt my skin so smooth except when I used to use a blade.  It conforms to your skin, even my neck comes out smooth (about 4 minutes to completely shave smooth, or I'll usually shave for less than a minute and get a shave that lasts until I get home from work).  It has a timer that not only tells you exactly how many minutes of battery are left, but it also tells you how many minutes you shaved for (which comes in handy more than I thought it would).  The best feature is that you can pop the top up and rinse it in water!  My brauns cleaned with refil cartridges that were hard to find and expensive and a hassel; whereas my old Norelco cleaned with a brush and never got really clean.  This one cleans easily and quickly, and even beeps to tell you when to clean it!  Also, this razor doesn't give me razor burn like my Brauns did!!<br /><br />If you are a first time shaver, or an expierenced shaver looking for a better shave from an electric razor, this is the one for you!  I will never buy any other brand of razor again and I'll probably have this one for years to come...",1
AHXEK642UJNWCB3LIGZZAKTONXQQ,B0001HYKBM,4,2006-04-07 13:39:02.000,Better than blade,"I've used this shaver for almost two years now and love it.  I'll never go back to a blade.  It takes some getting used to and practice, especially when shaving your neck, but once you get it down, it does a great job.<br /><br />You also don't need to buy the Nivea replacement packs.  I use regular shaving gel and it works perfectly.  I replaced the blades after about 18 months of use and it's like have a brand new shaver.<br /><br />My skin doesn't get irritated like it does with a blade, even if I have to shave twice a day.<br /><br />It's easy to clean and take care of too.  Being able to use it in the shower and just rinse it off is a real time saver.",1
AHXEK642UJNWCB3LIGZZAKTONXQQ,B0001HYLQQ,3,2006-04-07 13:41:48.000,Work but unnecessary,"Sure, it's very convenient to have to gel right inside the razor, but it can get expensive to constantly have to buy more of these packs.  I use regular shaving gel with my Cool Skin shaver and have never had a problem in the two years I have used it.  I still use the packs when traveling, just for the space savings.",0

I would recommend using sensitivity toothpaste while you are using the strips, it helped for me. It made my teeth noticeably whiter. I would suggest you take a picture of yourself smiling before and after. I noticed the whiteness of my teeth when I saw a picture taken recently and I couldn't believe how nice they looked. I just had to dig up an old picture to compare and it was a big difference. After I have noticed this in the new picture, I love smiling for pictures now and showing my teeth. I was alway self conscious about it before.  That alone makes it worth the price.<br /><br />I was very satisfied with my results. Make sure to read all the instructions before using.<br /><br />It just became a part of my bedtime routine, not a bother at all. I just put one on while I was watching my evening TV programs and just kept an eye on the clock.<br /><br />Also, I recommend that after you have finished your pack that you use the Crest whitening toothpaste.  It really helps to keep your teeth staying white.<br /><br />Great product and it was recommended to me by my dentist.",1

This review comes from much experience with the brand.<br /><br />This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs.  The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don't waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs.  I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway.  Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.<br /><br />Technically:  The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade.  Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70's, Jim Belushi said,  ""Buy a triple bladed razor.  For those that will believe anything"".  Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco's do a nice job.  Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion.  You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  The less pin-holes the better.<br /><br />Feel:  The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster.  It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.<br /><br />Function:  It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference.  It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.  Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.<br /><br />Battery:  Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  But, it states to not over-charge.  Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work.  The other units would shut off after charging.<br /><br />Cleaner/Charger:  Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge.  The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals.  I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can't blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can't be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).<br /><br />Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.

AGTIO2WD5NFWNXTFO57MJYCA5KWA,B000PKKAGO,4,2007-12-18 09:54:55.000,Sleek and modern,"I am reviewing this on behalf of my boyfriend who is the lucky user of this electric shaver. He still insists that razor a blade gives a closer shave and I agree, the skin is a lot smoother and clearer but this is great for the weekends when he wants to get rid of the stubble and not scratch my face off. This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!<br /><br />Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work. This makes a great holiday gift, a gadget that people wouldn't run out and buy for themselves necessarily and fun to have as an option in the morning.<br /><br />- Kasia S.",1
AGQ5ERLI2VUZVYLQV5WYJ5TLGVYA,B000PKKAGO,4,2007-12-18 20:19:27.000,Good for the frequent shaver,"The Philips Norelco Arcitec shaving system is designed to look good and feel good in your hand.  It also has handy packaging, coming with two handy storage/charge mounts: one designed to stand up in your bathroom and another secure case for travel.  Both mounts can be plugged in and charge the system.  The only thing I don't like about these mounts is they don't have a space to carry the cleaning brush.  Still, I haven't had to use the cleaning brush yet, since one of the best features of the Arcitec is that it can be cleaned in the tap: you just flip open the blade covers and run water over them.  It cleans nicely.  There is a very nice lcd display that shows how much battery time remains -- and the nice thing in terms of design is that you can't see the display unless it's on.  Otherwise it hides completely beneath the chrome like finish of the handle -- no ugly lcd display turned off.<br /><br />Enough about design: it looks great and feels great and has nice features.  What about function?  Does it shave well?  The answer to that is a bit more complicated.  The simple answer is: it gives a very smooth shave, IF you already have a fairly smooth shave.  If you shave at least once a day and preferably twice a day I find that it keeps the face smooth and polished, and feels very even across the skin and shaves quickly.  If you let it go for a day or two, however, and begin to show some stubble, the Arcitec doesn't like that.  It can run over fairly short stubble over and over again before it finally trims it.  Even the (fairly modest) click out trimmer can't cut significant stubble to a length that can be easily shaved by the Arcitec.  This is unfortunate for me, since I like to let it go a day or two between shaves.  I did, following the directions on the razor, give it about three weeks of solid shaving every day and that certainly did the trick keeping my skin feeling (almost) like a baby's, but I found after a few weeks I wanted to skip a day, and then tried to shave with the Arcitec and needed to pull out my disposable razor to finish the job.  (I should mention that I once had a much cheaper razor -- you know, the $30 variety -- that I got for Christmas several years ago and it did seem to have greater tolerance for longer stubble.  With that I could get away with shaving every couple of days.)<br /><br />So, to sum up: this razor is very well designed for the basic application of shaving at least once a day.  Very good for the distinguished gentleman, let's say.  But for those a bit rough around the edges (or, as someone might put the point less charitably) for those who are too lazy to shave every day, it may not be the ideal choice.",1
AE6AUO3Z6Q5N5VK2JDWGZEGFW4GA,B000FEF1V4,4,2008-03-05 15:07:32.000,A great way to trim your beard!,"This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don't make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.<br /><br />The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it's batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.<br /><br />The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.<br /><br />The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the ""Turbo"" button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don't get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.<br /><br />The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.<br /><br />Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!",1
AGQ5ERLI2VUZVYLQV5WYJ5TLGVYA,B000UK2VRK,4,2008-07-09 20:53:14.000,"Works great for me -- I like the smell of the lotion, and the smoothness it brings to the shave","This is another excellent shaving product from Philips -- it cuts like an ordinary shaver, but with the added benefit of lubrication that helps it to shave smoothly.  My skin doesn't get irritated or dry, and the lubrication seems to help the shave to go more quickly.  I've tried other brands of shavers and this one seems to work the best.<br /><br />This package comes with a squeeze bottle full of a very pleasant smelling lotion, that you inject into the back of the shaver.  Then, when you are shaving, you just press a button and it releases enough lotion to lubricate about one third of the face.  When it starts to feel like a dry shave, you press the button again and finish up.<br /><br />I have found that the amount of lotion you can inject into the shaver is enough for about 5 to 6 shaves.  The shaver comes with a small sample bottle of the lotion -- and I guess one drawback is that you have to keep buying the lotion, unless you want to use this like an ordinary dry shaver.  I've tried that too and it seems to work as well as any other shaver I've tried.  I prefer, though, to use the lotion.  It feels good and has a nice aftershave smell that my wife also likes -- that's good enough for me.<br /><br />Because the system is water resistant, you can shave in the shower, and you can wash it off in water when you are finished.  The extendable trimmer isn't very useful, but I've never seen a shaver where they are.  It comes fully recharged and after about two weeks of using it about every other day it is still working well -- I haven't charged it yet.  I do wish there was some kind of indicator on the unit that would let me know how much charge remains, but all in all I am quite happy with this.",1
AEHOFUNZP6VT74RUDDCJ2VVIT56A,B000HHANVW,2,2009-05-07 12:35:51.000,Avoid. Buy a 'true' Sonicare,"The lifespan of this device seems to be quite limited. A couple of years ago, I bought 2 of these for my 2 boys. One of them stopped working after a couple of weeks - was able to return it to Amazon and get a replacement - and the other stopped after a little over one month. The replacement stopped working after about one month as well.<br /><br />The big problem with this toothbrush is the battery compartment. Since it's using 'throw away' batteries, a bad thing by itself, there is a need for a lid to allow removal/insertion of batteries. At this price, the lid does not close tightly and water creeps in. Eventually, the entire thing stops working.<br /><br />Pros for this toothbrush:<br />- low price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- short life due to almost inevitable water damage<br />- use of 'throw away' batteries<br /><br />My recommendation: avoid.<br /><br />Spend a few more and get a true Sonicare. You won't regret it. I've been using Sonicare tooth brushes for almost 10 years now. My first one was replaced after more than 5 years, mostly because I wanted a new one. My current is alive and kicking and it's likely to last for many more years if I don't choose to replace it.",0

My wife gave me a near-professional-quality haircut in about 10-15 minutes and finished me with sufficient momentum to place our 12 yr. son under the cutter and 'even him out' as well.<br /><br />What you get:<br /><br />- The hair clipper body hosting the rechargeable batteries.<br />- The clipping attachment<br />- Stainless steel, self-sharpening cutting blades<br />- Large comb<br />- Small comb<br />- Stubble comb<br />- Charger<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- English/Spanish instructions<br />- Registration card with $20 coupon offer<br /><br />Some specs:<br /><br />- Battery life is rated at about 35 minutes.<br />- Charge time is 10 hours.<br />- Cuts hair from .12 in./3 mm to 1.61 in./41 mm.<br />- 15 length settings between the 3 combs (seven on each of the large and small combs plus the stubble comb)<br /><br />Returns and warranties:<br /><br />There's a 45-day money back guarantee promise if the customer can provide proof of purchase and ships the item, insured, to Norelco at own expense.<br /><br />The 2-year warranty promises to replace defective products for as long as the customer didn't do anything 'unreasonable' and he/she paid for shipping the item to Norelco, preferably insured. Proof of purchase, of course, is a must.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Other than the surprising ease of use and operation and the quality of the haircut, I liked the easy cleaning and maintenance and the fact that, if needed, it can operate in a 'corded' mode. The comfortable, rubberized grip makes hair cutting, even self-cutting easy and efficient.<br /><br />The brief manual is written in good English and is very good at illustrating cleaning and assembly and has very good advice on maintenance, preserving battery life and even some haircutting tips.<br /><br />Issues:<br /><br />My big problem and the only one so far is the lack of some case or storage box. With so many parts of which some are small and/or fragile, not providing some way to store them, protect them and keeping them organized is inexcusable.<br /><br />Rating:<br /><br />This would have been an easy 5-star if it came with a case. Since it doesn't, it gets 4.<br /><br />I still recommend the QC5055 most highly but be prepared to supply your own box or pouch - I did - or risk losing combs or the cleaning tools or maybe misplace the essential charger.",1

My son and I need haircuts every 3-4 weeks, so the dollars add up.<br /><br />These clippers make a lot of sense (cents? sorry). :)<br /><br />There's not a ton of difference between me telling the girl at Supercuts to ""use the #3 clippers on the sides and blend it on top"" versus doing it at home, except maybe the mess. These clippers surprised me though, because they don't throw the hair all over the room the way other clippers do.<br /><br />These clippers come with three different attachments: two for different hair lengths and one for a ""stubble"" finish. The attachments impressed me, because they were rigid enough to maintain a consistent length. I've had other trimmers where they were flimsy enough that applying pressure to the attachment would force it to cut shorter, which can be disastrous. I was also impressed with how well they clicked from setting to setting; the settings don't matter much if you can't click back to the one you want next time you use them.<br /><br />I was happy to see that you could clean these clippers under a running faucet. It made it a lot easier to get a good clean result when I was done.<br /><br />Finally, I was glad to see that I could use these clippers on my facial hair too. I don't like having different gadgets for different things, so it's nice to be able to use these clippers on my beard as well.<br /><br />_______________________________________<br />UPDATE:  7/19/2010<br /><br />I was using the trimmer this morning and thought maybe I should post an update on this review.  I still LOVE this trimmer, but the rechargeable battery has pretty much pooped out.  I'm really glad this trimmer isn't like other rechargeable devices where you can't use them and charge them at the same time.  So I just plug it in to use it...no big deal.<br /><br />The other thing to mention is that the combs are starting to get a little floppy, so I have to be more careful not to apply much pressure.  I scalped myself a little while trimming my beard today.  No big deal this time, because the beard grows so quickly.<br /><br />Bottom line...nearly a year later with LOTS of use and I still really like this product.  It won't last forever, but it's still pretty reliable.",1

She cuts my hair every 2-3 weeks and relies heavily on using electric shears to do so.  This unit works very well. It can work plugged in, or with battery, which should give you about 40 minutes of time per charge.<br /><br />The shears are sharp and do a great job of cutting through my thick hair. The attachments are also very nice. Unlike other units that have 6 or 7 different guards depending on what you want to do. It has a fixed length one, a short variable one, and a long variable one. For my hair she used the short variable one.  The settings go from 1/16 of a inch up to about 3/4 inch, and the long variable one goes up from there.<br /><br />Having the variable length guards is great as it reduces the number of guards you need and allows you to change lengths on the fly.<br /><br />Using the shears without the guard is also good for trimming to the skinline, edging and shaping.<br /><br />The only complaint my wife had is that she wishes it were a little more powerful on battery, but wasn't really lacking in power, it is just that she usually uses professional shears. This unit is actually as powerful or more powerful than most shears you buy at walmart or the like.<br /><br />Overall a great shear for home hair cutting.",1

We end up replacing them after about 3 years or so, but, at a price under $20 each, it still is cheaper than a Sonicare.  The replacement head brushes are about the same price as the more expenseive rechargeables, and we purchase them at Sam's and on line.  And, in the end, the results are what matter.  No one in our family has had a cavity in over 7 years.  Some of that has to be the results of a good toothbrushing (especially with my children).",1

There were a few key reasons I wanted one. First, wet/dry shaving sounded great, especially dry without wasting water down the drain. Also, the cost of replacement razors for the venus and similar items is ridiculous, so I'd only change it when it got very dull. Plus, I hated throwing away the plastic and adding to the landfills. The reviews of this seemed promising, and I'm glad to say, I definitely agree!<br /><br />The razor works really well dry shaving, and its so much easier then balancing precariously on one foot in a wet shower. Not too loud, once you get started you forget it's making any noise. According to the package, you need to replace the foils once a year and the razors in the machine every two years. Imagine the money I'll save! Especially if you go thru multiple 8 packs of venus razors a year. It doesn't get as close a shave as the regular razor, but thats not a big deal for me. I'll use this on a normal basis and get out the razor when I need the babysoft feel.<br /><br />I'm a big fan, and will never go back to using traditional razors full time.",1

The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it. Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length.  Turbo speed is really not necessary. Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style.  Overall, I feel it will work well but I am leary of the shavings door. It does a nice job, as I expected. I have no experience with any other brand to compare.  I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket.",1
AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B002CVTVW8,5,2010-07-09 22:09:11.000,Nice improvement,"This is a nice improvement to the Sonicare line of brushes. It appears to be their response to the Oral-B Floss Action line of brushes that have a ""paddle"" to help get between teeth. This accomplishes that goal with an plastic insert in the middle that helps direct the toothpaste between your teeth.<br /><br />I use both the Sonicare (Healthy White) and the Oral B 5000. Both have their pluses and minuses, so switching between the two gives me the best of both worlds.<br /><br />The Oral-B arrangement of paddles does a better job in getting at the gum line without discomfort. The Sonicare Hydroclean's bristles are stiffer and I find that they irritate my gums when used several times in a row.<br /><br />But, the Sonicare does a better job in cleaning stains between teeth. I'm a tea drinker and getting the stains out between my front teeth has always been a chore. The Hydroclean works very well - noticeable improvement over the Sonicare ProResults and the Oral-B.<br /><br />These only come in the standard size. The ProResults has a smaller version that is great for getting at the tight spots. But, I assume that a smaller version of this would not function well since the plastic insert would have to be very small.<br /><br />If you're a ProResults user these are well worth trying out. If you have tender gums you may want to alternate between the HydroClean and the ProResults (or, as I do, with the Oral-B. The Oral-B also makes a super soft brush if you have very sensitive gums. Hard to find, but works very well).<br /><br />Keep in mind that nothing takes the place of flossing. No matter what you use, you still need to break out the floss to keep your teeth healthy!",1

They are very effective, leaving the teeth looking and feeling clean. Problem: The units don't last long. Mine died after seven months, after a normal level of use. You can't get into the unit to see if the battery contacts need readjusting or something--if anything inside goes wrong, you're looking at purchasing a new unit. Like I just did, not having found a more durable alternative on the market. (The quality of the Sonicares I formerly used declined to the point where a unit typically lasted only a month or two.)",1

Generally, she does not like gadgets and new technology, but this toothbrush is easy to operate.  I recommended that she does not charge it after every brushing but rather only when the low battery indicator turns on, and she's been following this suggestion.  She tried one of the included small brush heads, but she really prefers the larger double action brush head.

AEHOFUNZP6VT74RUDDCJ2VVIT56A,B000PKNPES,4,2011-01-18 15:34:02.000,"Above average shaver, doesn't irritate my skin, pretty","The Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men's Shave]] which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL's heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a 'lightning deal' for some $35 more so I took advantage of the opportunity. After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is 'better' that the 8140XL and I am therefore pleased with my purchase. While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same 'lift and cut' technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.<br /><br />But, let's go into some details:<br /><br />PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND PRESENTATION<br /><br />The shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer. It's not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don't suffer any damage while in transit.<br /><br />Inside I found:<br /><br />- The shaver itself<br />- Super-protective (for travel mostly) charging pod<br />- Cleaning brush<br />- Charging stand<br />- Sliding razor head cap<br />- 100/240V power cord<br />- User manual and warranty statement (English/Spanish)<br />- Quick start guide card<br /><br />Taking the shaver out of its packaging, understanding its operation and making it work was relatively easy.<br /><br />The manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it's a 1050). It covers everything, from features, charging options, shaving tips and techniques, cleaning, storage and replacement of the razor head. I've actually read it and I am better off for it.<br /><br />FEATURES AND OPERATION<br /><br />Charging<br />--------<br />This is one of Arcitec's better features. The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged. I didn't count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won't need to recharge it very often. In 'emergencies', just 3 minutes of charging should give you 3 minutes of shave time.<br /><br />There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec's precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue. After all these years the battery still allows me to shave several times before a recharge is needed.<br /><br />You charge your shaver by either placing it on the charging stand or inside the charging pod. Philips recommends that you do not keep the charging stand continuously connected to the power outlet and I have no problem with that. One one-hour charge session keeps my shaver going for several weeks (I only shave 2-3 times per week).<br /><br />Shaving<br />--------<br />The feature most of us buy a shaver for :)... It's okay, for an electric shaver. I won't say that ""it's as close as a blade"" because it isn't but that's not why I switched from blade shaving to electric some 7 years ago. I am using an electric shaver because shaving with a blade had my skin irritated, especially on my neck. The 8140XL was okay but my neck still felt uncomfortable. The Architec does NOT irritate my neck at all and this is a very good thing.<br /><br />The above comes with a price. Shaving takes a lot longer. You need to go over the same area several times before all the hairs are 'lifted and cut' but that was a tradeoff I understood and I accepted. Norleco claim that the Arcitec has ""50% more shaving surface"" (compare with the old 8140XL claim of ""up to 50% more shaving surface"") is just marketing hype and always left me ask myself ""50% more than what?"". The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec's are not larger than the 8140XL's but I would not call them 'humongously large"". And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not 'fast'.<br /><br />As I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model. Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because 'lift and cut' is good but not perfect but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.<br /><br />Trimmer<br />--------<br />A small trimmer can be pulled out when needed. I am not going to use it that much but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache. It's a useful feature.<br /><br />Other bells and whistles<br />-----------------------<br />When needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver's body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement indicator.<br /><br />MAINTENANCE<br /><br />I don't like spending a lot of time taking care of my shaving tools and the Arcitec does not need a lot of maintenance. Each of the 3 individual heads can be opened and the hair fragments stored inside are washed away in seconds. Any that don't go can be removed with the providing brush. It's possible to also use liquid soap or degreasing liquid (alcohol) solutions for cleaning but I haven't yet.<br /><br />The trimmer, if used extensively, could use a couple of drops of mineral oil once or twice per year.<br /><br />Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an 'replace head' indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes but we are not there yet and I will be making that decision when the time comes.<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />There is a 45-day money back guarantee. Philips Norelco promise to fully refund your purchase price if you ship them back the product within 45 days of your purchase date. You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items - therefore the need for insurance.<br /><br />In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver or you try to fix it your self or through unauthorized repairers.<br /><br />The 800 numbers you need to call for support or warranty service are printed on several locations on the box and on the manual.<br /><br />Made in Holland.<br /><br />DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS<br /><br />'The looks' is clearly Arcitec's distinguishing feature. I like it but I'm not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon's page. As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time. The Arcitec's body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving. I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.<br /><br />The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it's not easy to close/open and it can't store then shaver while the heads cap is on. I didn't take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don't believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I'm not so sure the bulkiness is justified.<br /><br />Finally, I wish there was some 'case' to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it's possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are 'outside' and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.<br /><br />MY RATING<br /><br />I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my 'regular' shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that's what our reviews are for.<br /><br />I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",1

As of now, the SpeedXL is still in perfect working order and it's likely to be one of my kids first shavers when they are going to need a first shaver (soon).<br /><br />I am writing this only to testify to the quality of this product. I had no problems with it whatsoever, it never let me down, the battery still holds enough charge for maybe half a dozen shaves, runs as silently as on day one and it's a near-zero maintenance item, requiring nothing beyond the heads cleaning after each shave by placing them under the faucet. The one issue I had was that the skin on my neck got irritated from time to time but it was never anything major that wouldn't go away after a few hours.<br /><br />Si, it's goodbye to the SpeedXL for me (hello Arcitec) but it's not this shaver's end of career.

After this last time, i thought i would give Oral B a try to see how they hold up.<br /><br />The toothbrush heads are very different. Sonicare uses a more oval shape that is smaller than a regular toothbrush(which i like because it can fit in your mouth easier) and Oral B uses a circular shape. I feel that the Oral B cleans your gums a bit better because it is more wide and can reach your gums, even when you're not trying to, just when you're normally brushing your teeth. The slimmer oval shape of the sonicares do not do this when you're doing a normal brushing. I feel as though this could be a plus or a con depending on the individual. some people have sensitive gums and may not like that you cannot control the Oral B to stay away from the gums, however it gets the job done all at once. Between the two, they both do a great job of getting your teeth feeling very clean, sonicare may do it very slightly better, but both are MUCH better than a regular toothbrush. I could never go back.<br /><br />The vibrations of the sonicares are, i feel, more controlled. When i use the Oral B's i can feel the vibrating in my head and my vision gets a little weird while i'm brushing, the sonicares do not do this. This was the biggest issue for me when using the Oral B's. It's a bit annoying.<br /><br />The brush heads are VERY expensive for the sonicares! I buy mine from costco, and i spend about $50 for 7 brush heads. For one person, thats not so bad, but when you have a family of four, thats $50+ every 6 months. So maintaining them is not cheap. Oral B is about $40 for 8. They're a little bit cheaper, not by too much, but enough to give you something to think about.<br /><br />Overall i would say the Sonicares perform better, but often break. While the Oral B are cheaper, and last longer. If you are trying to decide between the two, i would look at how much you want to spend as the bottom line. They're both going to get your teeth exceptionally clean, and if you're going to have a metaphorical aneurism when your sonicare breaks, it might be a lesser disappoint to get a oral b. I've owned my oral b's for over a year now, and have not had one break-yet.",1

AEGZUGS74AIXKND3LQEAZAS4NVNA,B00AX3YNPC,4,2013-04-21 21:08:48.000,another solid epilator from Braun (plus no more underarm bumps!),"Some quick thoughts on this model specifically:<br />* Removes smaller hairs (0.5mm) than older models, so you can be more aggressive as stray hairs start to grow back<br />* The ""massagers"" on the epilation head really do help<br />* You can use it dry or completely-wet, but not damp (e.g., right after the shower won't work)... and I must say that using it under running water dramatically reduces any discomfort, although it's a bit harder to notice stray hairs<br />* You can't use it while plugged in (that would be a serious safety hazard in the shower!) but it means that whenever the battery eventually stops holding a charge, you'll have to toss the unit)<br />* I wish this included a trimming head like other models, for the cases when you have longer hairs you want to attack (they have to be 7 mm or shorter before this will really pull them out)<br />* This doesn't include an attachment for facial hair like some do (which is OK)... just make sure that your epilator is clean if you're going to use it on your face, because otherwise it will make you break out<br />* The small spotlight on the unit makes it much easier to see hairs you may have missed<br />* The exfoliating brush is a nice touch, because epilating frequently leads to ingrown hairs. It says to use it a day or two before epilating, and it's super-gentle... almost feels like it's not doing anything, but I found it's more effective and more comfortable (if more slow) than just using a loofah. The ""wait 2 days"" advice is good because otherwise your skin gets sensitive<br /><br />And some thoughts on epilation in general:<br />* This seems obvious, but I have to say it: it only hurts when a hair is being removed. This means that the first time you epilate, it's very uncomfortable. But since only a small percentage of the hair grows back before you epilate again (assuming you do it at least once every 3 months!), the subsequent touch-ups really aren't bad at all, especially on your legs. (Underarms are less comfortable, and bikini area even less so. Face is also quite sensitive, though that probably varies by person, depending on how much tweezing you normally do.)<br />* The first time you epilate, your legs will be unbelievably smooth. But hair grows back at different rates, so after a month or so of epilating (maybe one time each week), you'll have tiny hairs here and there, that are starting to grow back but are still too small to get. It's less of an issue with this epilator than others, and the hairs aren't really visible. So if you think someone's going to be touching your legs, then shave :-D but otherwise life is much easier if you just epilate once a week or so. Then if you don't bother doing anything for a month or so, you'll have a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing like someone who shaves regularly and then skips a month (or even a week... or even 3 days). Visible stubble is entirely a thing of the past.<br />* Remember that the exfoliation is important to prevent ingrown hairs (just little bumps on your legs--mine don't turn red). But if you wax, or if you age ;) you'll have to do that anyway. And this unit's exfoliator is more gentle than a loofah<br />* And how could I forget the #1 reason to epilate: no more underarm bumps. You know, the ones that you ALWAYS have, despite a million products on the market that say they'll banish them but don't? Sometimes when you epilate, your skin will be red for 30-90 seconds afterward, but then it fades. So NO MORE BUMPS. That alone is reason enough to own an epilator, IMO :)  This also helps with bikini-area bumps, but I find in those cases that the redness can take several hours to fade, so it's fantastic to use the day before swimming but would not be a good choice immediately before pool time",1

AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B005AQC9U8,5,2013-10-03 16:29:28.000,Pure retro red,"When everyone was wearing clear or neutral glosses, I wasn't phased. I'm a red lipstick addict from way back, and I just toned down the red and added a little gloss to update it.<br /><br />Thank God, though, it looks like real, pure reds are making a comeback. I read about Besame's vintage cosmetics line, and as my MAC red was about gone, I figured I'd try one of their reds.<br /><br />My coloring is a brunette with a very fair complexion. Frankly, except for goth dark reds, I can wear pretty much any shade. I picked Besame Red since it seemed middle of the line in terms of color, and I wanted to get an idea how this cosmetics line worked.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me is it comes on a card. This lipstick isn't cheap; you'd think the packaging would be a little nicer. (I get they're trying to do vintage cosmetics, but if you're going to make it look like Coty or Max Factor from the 40s, you probably don't want to charge a hefty price for it.)<br /><br />The other surprise is that the tube isn't heavy. Everyone raves about the metal container, but like so? It's lightweight. I've had some heavy lipstick containers from luxury lines that bragged about the lipstick containers being jewel-like, and they were.<br /><br />This container isn't.<br /><br />So now with my quibbles out of the way, let me say the lipstick itself is NICE. Some said the lipstick is small; it isn't. It seems about the size of most lipsticks with a double bevel to make putting it on easy.<br /><br />I always use a lipbrush (does away with lipliner and makes lipstick in the case last FOREVER. You'll get tired of the lipstick before it runs out.)<br /><br />The first surprise is the scent. I don't recall any lipstick except some glosses having a discernable scent. This one does, rather vanilla-y. It's pleasant.<br /><br />The lipstick texture in the tube is, surprisingly, moist. It goes on easily, but it's not so moisturizing that the color doesn't last.<br /><br />I put it on and did the old fashioned lip blotting with a piece of toilet paper. With a super slushy lipstick, this will almost take the entire thing off. Not so with Besame. The color is very saturated and stayed on my lips nicely.<br /><br />The lip blotting didn't get rid of the moisture. My lips still feel nice. The color lightened up a bit (which happens with blotting.) You're supposed to add another layer of lipstick after this, but I usually don't. The color was still very saturated, so there was no need for more.<br /><br />The staying power is excellent! It lasted all day, and my lips never dried out.<br /><br />If you love the color (and use a lipbrush), you'll get WAY more out of this true red to the point where you'll get tired of it before it runs out.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to be investigating more of the Besame line.<br /><br />N.B. One other trick that works if you want your lipstick to last into next week. Blot the first coat and put on a bit of powder with your finger - baby powder or compact powder does nicely. Blot again, and put on another coat of lipstick. It'll last through dinner and into next Christmas. :)",1

I've used a few different models and this isn't a lot different than the last couple, but it was my first wet/dry version and I like it.<br /><br />I don't recommend using the epilator in the shower (standing up) unless you've got fantastic balance and a super non-slip tub or shower, because even as used to it as I was, I still jumped a few times. I found sitting down to be the easiest way to use it, either immediately after a bath or on the edge of the tub during a shower. It didn't work as well on dry-ish or moist skin following a shower/bath but did great on actual wet skin - after using it for a while, I actually prefer it to using the epilator on dry skin now (I have painfully dry skin though and your mileage may vary).<br /><br />I think the pain factor is what keeps most people away from epilators. I won't say it's painless, but the pain varies depending on where you're using it, what heads you're using, what speed you're using and of course, how sensitive you are. This is basically large-scale, fast tweezing and the first time, it stings. Cooling off with the included soothing pack, if you need it, helps, as does some cool lotion. It gets better - I barely notice it now and honestly, being able to go two-plus weeks without having to shave/epilate is worth five minutes of any sort of stinging.",1

I'd say, twice the size of an eye shadow jar (l'oreal hip eye shodow) http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Shocking-Shadow-Pigments-Unashamed/dp/B001H9408G/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1391448655&sr=8-3&keywords=l%27oreal+hip+eye+shadow<br /><br />I did not return this item.

The oil does a very good job of conditioning and softening my beard and preventing fly-aways. You need to use it consistently and it takes a little time for it to really take effect but I truly does work great. Your beard will be softer without looking oily. It’s also scent free which I strongly prefer. Another review said it has a lemon scent. I’m not getting that and typically I’m pretty sensitive to odors. If there’s a scent it’s very subtle. I also use this oil for leg shaving. It makes the shaving process faster and safer (little to no cuts or nicks). Oil is preferable to cream so you can see what you’re doing and where you’re shaving. It’s thick enough to not require much product but not so thick that your razor is instantly gummed up. I’ve also used Pacific Shaving Company oil (too thin) and Shave Secret oil (too thick). Since this is an oil, I don’t often use it for moisturizing but it’s very effective in that capacity particularly if you have a very dry and stubborn area. I’m giving this product 5 stars because it works great for all it’s intended uses but the reality is that I’m unsure how often I will purchase it due to it’s high price. I will have to wait and see how long a bottle lasts. So far a little bit goes a long way so it very well may end up being worth the high price.",1

It’s annoying and painful, especially at night. I’ve tried all sorts of moisturizers without much success. The best results (if you can call it that) have been from using petroleum jelly, but that’s messy and it still doesn’t work well.<br /><br />This argan oil, however, has been hugely effective. It gave me results right from the first day, and over the course of just a few days I can see noticeable healing of the skin cracks. No more pain and my hands feel far better than any other treatment I’ve tried.<br /><br />The product comes very nicely packaged, with a nice box filled with shredded packing material to keep the glass bottle safe in transit. It also makes for a very nice presentation should you want to give this as a gift. The bottle comes with a dropper and a “spritz” head. The latter is my only quibble – the spray head didn’t work well at all, and made sort of a mess when using it to dispense the oil. I replaced it with the dropper and had much better results.<br /><br />The oil itself has little or no scent. You need very, very little for results – I use about 1-2 small drops per hand, and that’s more than enough. It spreads easily (as expected given that it’s oil). It does take a few minutes to soak in – my hands are very greasy when I first apply it, but after a few minutes the greasiness goes away. The sheen from the oil stays around longer, but that too dissipates after 30 minutes or so.<br /><br />This can be used for a wide range of applications including face, body and even hair. It comes with a good amount of information to help explain how/where to use it, and how the oil was processed.<br /><br />I’m very impressed with this oil – it’s the only product I’ve ever tried that totally worked to solve my dry/cracked hands. It’s not cheap, but well worth the price if you need a highly effective moisturizer. Highly recommend.<br />[Sample provided for review]",1

Not so with this brand. This brand has the natural scent of the real deal, and is effective to boot. I have a baby, so have been washing my hands about 10 times a day, every time I change his diaper. Between that and all of the diaper wipes I use, my hands have been starting to peel and crack, so I knew I needed a solution.<br /><br />This argan oil came with a regular lid, an eyedropper, and a pump dispenser. I used the pump dispenser and set it right next to my faucet so I could get a quick pump of oil every time I wash my hands. Well, it only took a couple of days to experience really great results. My hands feel normal again, and I am so relieved. From hard skin that was rough and crackled, to soft, happy hands again.<br /><br />I have also used the product on my split ends, and here, I’d like to caution you that only a few drops are needed. It is very effective and soaks and well, so you only need a very small amount.<br /><br />Overall, this argan oil is one of the best I have found. It comes packaged beautifully and looks like a gift, has multiple options for how you dispense it, and is pure, organic, and has the mild scent of real argan oil, unlike some competitors.",1

The scent seems to be reactivated by arm movement. I don't know how this works, but I'm guessing it has to do with friction and how the product layers on to your body such that you &#34;scrape&#34; off some of it when you're active. If you've frequently found yourself with body odor issues during or after exercise, this can be a very good thing. My main problem is that I'm not a fan of the strong scent. It's just a bit overbearing for my tastes. There are other similar deodorants in this series (the &#34;Cool Rush&#34; version smells better to me) which I'd go for.

If I didn't actually have to still 'brush my teeth' manually with this electric toothbrush, maybe it would be fine. However, it's not the case.

AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,B00JMDPK8S,3,2014-07-09 16:55:47.000,"Great brush, some drawbacks","Update:  I am lowering my rating to 3 stars because of the difficulty and expense of finding and buying replacement heads.  I couldn't find any for quite some time.  I've since found some online, not on Amazon, but from a low of $19.99 (but out of stock) to more than $25 for a single head.  The difficulty and cost makes buying this brush too impractical, which is too bad because I like the unit.<br />~~~~~~~<br /><br />The toothbrush I reviewed is the similar model, EW-DE92.  I was taken to this page when I tried to post my review.<br /><br />First, and most important, I love the way this brush cleans my teeth.  Using the ""white"" mode, they feel nice and fresh and thoroughly cleansed.  According to the owner's guide, some people can feel that slight electric charge, the ionic feature, when using the brush, and I am one of those people.  However, it is extremely mild and not the least unpleasant.<br /><br />I like that there are various settings on this brush although I use ""white"" most often.  The gum brush may be useful but I don't use it as routinely as suggested because it just doesn't feel like it is doing much for me.  I do like to use the little pointy rubber head but again, not as often as the regular head.  I do like the tongue cleaner on this brush.<br /><br />Which brings me to one of the drawbacks.  I cannot seem to find replacement heads for this product.  I looked on Amazon and I went to the Panasonic site with no success.  I went to the same model toothbrush on both sites and there are no links to the replacement heads.  I wanted to order some in advance so I would have then when needed.  Perhaps this is a new model and replacement heads will become widely available, but this toothbrush is expensive to begin with, and much more so if heads cannot be found.<br /><br />Compared to my basic but rechargeable Philips Sonicare toothbrush, this one is nicer to hold because the handle is much slimmer.  The Sonicare seems to have a more robust brushing action, but this one seems to get my teeth just as clean, perhaps marginally cleaner.<br /><br />The charger seems to work well.  I took the brush on a 10-day trip and chanced not taking the charger with me, and I had no loss of power during that trip.  It seems to hold its charge quite well.<br /><br />But there is a downside to the charger too.  According to the manual again, the lithium battery lasts about 3 years.  When the battery is dead, I am supposed to ""Contact an authorized service center for repair.""  Now that is just not practical and probably not cheap, and this toothbrush costs too much to not be able to replace the battery without service costs.<br /><br />One more drawback is the storage of the various heads.  This set comes with a little stand to store the heads, but none of the heads have a protective cover and the storage stand does not have a cover, so the heads are sitting out in the bathroom air, something I don't like at all.  The travel case holds the handle and one head but not the extra heads.  My cheaper Sonicare has a plastic cap that comes with each head to protect it.<br /><br />While I think this is a very good toothbrush, the drawbacks need to be fixed before I would consider getting another one.  At current prices, this one costs more than twice my Sonicare, and while this one has more bells and whistles, I don't believe the price difference is justified.",0

The claim for that being unlike most curlers, this one works so well that you don't need replacements. Obviously I cannot give my claim to that one as I have only had this curler for a couple of weeks. So far the pad has held up wonderfully as you would hope it would.  The pad is black in color, and the handles of the curler are a dark pink. Feels durable, and not flimsy.<br /><br />Using this is pretty basic. If you know how to curl your lashes, then you know what to do. I tested this curler against my current drug store curler. On my left eye I did this one by Bella and Bear, on the right, my old curler. I didn't experience any pinching, or discomfort while using this one. My end results after putting on 1 coat of mascara were pretty much identical. I honestly couldn't tell much of a difference. The curl also stayed for the same amount of time as my drug store curler.<br /><br />The final thing that made me give this 3 stars is the price. My drug store curler cost me about $10. If the price was a bit more competitive with other curlers that provide the same results, then I would definitely up this rating to 4 stars.<br /><br />*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.",0
AGKVC3TSM7DTU2FC63M23YBM6JMA,B001ET7HJI,5,2014-09-09 16:57:59.000,"Thank You, Earth Therapeutics!!","My bedroom faces the east and has an uncovered half-moon window above the one with blinds.  In the summer the light begins to pour in before 5 AM and, being a light sleeper, I would wake up and have a difficult time getting back to sleep afterwards, which eventually, led me to search for a sleep mask.<br /><br />I purchased these masks and another, molded one that came with earplugs.  This is my very favorite and I shared the second of the set with my night-shift working daughter, as I felt it might help her get more rest during the day as well.  I've been using mine for a few months now and absolutely love it.<br /><br />It does take a little bit of getting used to, just to the feel of something on your face and around your head.  I've felt a little irritation on my ears occasionally but can easily adjust it to relieve that.  It fits my face and stays in place quite well without having the band on tightly.  I am a ""tummy sleeper"", and this mask is so soft that it doesn't feel uncomfortable against my pillow.  It's just wonderful!<br /><br />I have not noticed any scent on the ones that I received, and I checked because of the other reviewers comments.  I've hand-washed it numerous times now, then let it air dry and it's ready to go again.  If anything, it's just become softer but has not shown any signs of wear beyond that.  I'm now looking to order more, just to have on hand when this one is ready to be replaced.<br /><br />The other, molded one seems a bit bigger but sits off your eyes, if that sensation would bother you.  I have a little more difficulty getting it to block all the light as well as this one, but it could be more attractive for larger faces or folks that are bothered by having something constantly touching their eyes like this one does.  Just my thoughts on that. . .<br /><br />I've read many articles recently on the importance of getting adequate sleep for your mental and physical health.  If you are looking at sleep masks, you're probably wanting to improve your rest for some reason.  I'd recommend you give this mask a try.  I don't understand why some seem scented and some aren't, but I am 100% pleased with the masks I received.  Most of those reviews are pretty old if you note that.",1

It is nice and thick and I only need a dab on each cheek and a little on my forehead to cover my entire face. It makes my skin feel so soft and has done an awesome job at keeping it moisturized. I have tried a lot of brands of these creams and this one is right up there with all the top notch name brands that every one knows. I would buy this one again if I ever run out of my large stock of creams I now have. It is very nice and doesn't irritate my skin at all.,1

AGZKLDUDYELPMHACIWTGAYSQHSSA,B00K5RZIKA,5,2014-09-29 18:21:02.000,Such A Great Kit!,"I absolutely love this kit. I have quite a collection of makeup brushes, however I didn't have a eyebrow brush. Most of the time I would just use whatever brush I could find to do my brows. Since using this kit, my brows look a million times better!<br /><br />The angled brush is the perfect width for brows. I use this with a brow powder, and it makes placing the product so easy, and you can manipulate the brush to create the illusion of eye brow hair. The brush is just overall fantastic. On the opposite end there is a spoolie. I like to use this in between swipes with the brush. I can brush out my brows, apply some product, and brush them out again. This gives my brows a very natural look, without taking away the product I just applied. It also softens them so they don't look harsh. Love it.<br /><br />The next piece in the kit is the eye lash comb and brow brush. I use the eye lash brush after applying mascara and letting it dry. This will remove any clumps that your mascara may have left, and fans out your lashes to look fuller and just amazing! The brow brush I use more often when I am using an eyebrow wax. Once I apply the wax, I can use this brush to create a more natural look. Again, it's fantastic!<br /><br />I really like this kit. It is a staple in my collection, and gets used daily. I love the packaging this comes in, if you need to travel, this is perfect! Place your brushes in the cylinder and they will be perfectly protected! 5 stars all around for this kit!<br /><br />*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.",1

I am a sucker for packaging. I am guilty of buying something simply because it comes wrapped in a pretty package. Crave is so clever in their packaging it makes me want every product they have to offer.<br />Guess what? Their products are just as awesome as what they come in.  Last time, I got the Whip Lash Eye Lash curler, you can read my review here. This time I received their eyebrow kit!<br />It comes with two awesome tools to help me maintain my sorry excuse for eyebrows. The first tool has a comb to help me separate my clumpy ass eye lashes. Even with the best mascara you can get, it's always a good idea to keep a tool to separate your eyelashes. No one wants to see your spider lashes!! On the other side of the comb is a little brush you can use on your lashes, or your eyebrows.<br />The second tool, my favorite, has a mascara type applicator on one end, this applicator is great for grooming your eyebrows before you put on your makeup. It gets them looking even and neat, or to help accentuate your arch. The other end is an eyebrow makeup applicator brush. This small brush helps you apply  your eyebrow makeup with precision. I highly recommend this product! Look at the cute tube it comes in! I am saving that, I don't know why or what I will ever use it for but I am never throwing it away :)",1

Normally when I brush my hair it comes out a lot and hurts while I brush as it rips out of my head. Wet hair is the worst for me but this brush went through almost like butter. There was no painfull pulling of my hair like before and it took less time for me to brush because I had an easier time getting through my tangled hair. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length. The design of this brush also makes it feel great in the palm of your hand.,1

AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA,B00KW4EF6Y,3,2014-10-15 00:47:04.000,No noticeable results after over a month - UPDATED 11/9/14,"NOTE:  I received a free sample of this product to review.<br /><br />Like the hair on my head, my eyelashes are thin and fine.  Without mascara, they are barely noticeable.  I have never before tried an eyelash growth serum and was frankly somewhat skeptical, yet at the same time, I was excited at the thought that this product might be beneficial.<br /><br />This serum is packaged in a tube that looks like mascara.  However, the inner wand ends in a tiny brush that is like a VERY thin paintbrush.  I would have preferred a slightly thicker applicator; the brush was SO small that it was difficult to see the serum for precise application.<br /><br />I followed the instructions for this product, applying nightly along my lash line.  I used this product daily for over a month (since late August).  Unfortunately, I am not able to discern any noticeable results.  I actually took photos, thinking that might show more of a difference, I but do not see any changes in the photos, either.  (It looks like Amazon has finally posted my photos, so you can see what you think for yourself.)<br /><br />The only small improvement I have noticed of late is that AFTER applying my mascara, my lashes seem longer than they normally would with mascara--it's almost as if they are somehow adhering to the mascara better than they would normally.  I'm not 100% sure if this is a real effect, but that possible sign combined with the fact that I didn't have any adverse reactions to this product is the reason why I gave it two stars rather than one.  Perhaps others will have better luck than I did.<br /><br />UPDATED 11/9/14:  Despite my lack of results after one month, I continued to use this product.  It has now been over two months, and I believe that I have seen SOME results.  At this point, my lashes DO appear longer--I think that's why my mascara has seemed to be working better, as my lashes are a bit longer than before.  However, my results have been nothing like the miracles in the photos posted on the product page--yes, my lashes are a bit longer, but the effect is hardly noticeable to the bare eye (I asked my husband, and he didn't notice).  Furthermore, my lashes are neither thicker nor more plentiful; this product gave me a bit of length only, not thickness or any other effect.  So, in summary, I upgraded my review from two to three stars, but I don't feel like I can go beyond that at this time.",0

I do love scents so it had one, it wouldn’t have bothered me. BUT there are some who prefer no scent.<br />The cream feels so light on my skin, I can’t tell I have it on. After my morning shower, I apply my normal serum product and then the Key West Health & Beauty Retinol Cream. It absorbs quickly and easily and I can wear it under my makeup. By the time I brush my teeth after application, it’s dry and I can then put on my makeup.<br />I have been using this cream on my face and neck once a day and I’m happy with the results. I apply it to my hands and feet once a day as well, except I do these areas at bedtime. I really want to stress that this is a great Retinol Cream for those of you who are looking for more youthful skin.",1

The cream has very small chunks in it that for me at least don't really dissolve on my skin even when wet. I have to wipe off the excess after using this. I do love the packaging though.

The pump is quality as well. I've had some that are all over the place. I use one pump for my neck and one for my face. I tend to have oily areas on my face but this seems to be reducing that problem. The scent is faint which I like but I love that it's made in America and not tested on animals. Great product!",1

The Remineralization was really beneficial and helped with my teeth sensitivity and prepared them for the whitening.  The Remineralization also helps strengthen enamel which is also something I need as well.

AGCXLRMTTQO4VGIB3RWMXECECWTQ,B0097G4QY4,4,2014-12-15 19:40:41.000,A beauty industry expert's professional opinion,"Not all Obagi products are made at the same place -- but i found out that this formula is made by one of the top skincare labs in the US--one that manufactures high-end dermatologist and clinical skincare brands on the market today. So knowing this, i knew there would be *some* efficacy to this product. I actually LIKE that ingredients are straightforward and not full of fluff:<br /><br />Water (Aqua), Dipropylene Glycol, Ethoxydiglycol, Caffeine, Malonic Acid, Zinc Carbonate, Arginine, Laureth-9, Copper Carbonate Hydroxide, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sodium Hydroxide, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin<br /><br />To be honest--if you're looking to reduce eye puffiness and dark circles, this won't do much.  If found no visible evidence of that in my use. BUT--it's really good at minimizing fine lines, plumping up the skin, and returning elasticity to the skin. That's why it's called ""Elasti-derm"", to help coax the skin into being more hydrated, refined, and pliant, thus reducing the signs of lines. Obagi's main active to do that is malonic acid, and I give a big thumbs up to the addition of arginine-- a powerful delivery vehicle to help drive the malonic acid further into the skin for more efficacy. As many in the skincare industry know, anything with arginine helps make the active ingredient even more ""active"".<br /><br />The stainless steel ball is not just a ""feel good"" gimmick -- it actually helps to massage this serum into the delicate eye skin, further pushing the ingredients into the dermis. After using an entire bottle of this product, i definitely experienced a reduction in the signs of my fine lines. the skin was plumped up and the lines less visible, plus the texture more refined. Used in conjunction with a good eye cream and alternating with Vitamin C serum, this is a great addition to any anti-aging regimen. I would surely purchase again.<br /><br />I take off one star because I do not like the plastic packaging, as glass is the safest material for stability, and plastic has a tendency to shorten the shelf life of a formula. Plus plastics are not as safe we think.",1

The box was very large and packed in a cute floral box titled &#34;The Kitten&#34;<br />I opened the box and pulled out a large black case, it was very soft and had a zipper with a heart attached to it. The Bella and Bear logo is embossed on the front of this case.<br />I hadn't even opened up the case and knew that these brushes were high quality.<br />When I did open it, I am pretty sure I heard angels singing lol (okay I admit it, I LOVE makeup, makeup brushes and all beauty products so this was super exciting)<br />Inside the case held the softest most luxurious feeling brushes I have ever used! The brushes laid neatly 4 sections, it opens like a book. The inside cover had brushes, then the middle &#34;page&#34; held brushes on both sides, and then the outer side of the case had the rest of brushes.<br />Each brush has it own unique name, the case comes with a leaflet with the names of each brush and explaining what they are used for. This is my 7th brush set and the ONLY one that actually showed what they are used for. I was pretty clueless and had to look them up online.<br />As for the use of the brushes, they work wonderful. It have yet to experience a single brush hair fall out. As I stated before they are so soft and feel so nice when I use them on my face. I love the fact that it comes with a small thin brush that I can use for my gel eyeliner. This set contains a brush for all of your makeup needs.<br />I highly recommend this as a present to  yourself or for any makeup lover in your life. You will fall in love with them as much as I did! I have tried other products from this company and I am very impressed with their products and their packaging!

When I was looking for a new one to replace my worn out one, I was given the opportunity to purchase this one at a discounted price so I could try it out. This is a nice, light weight sleeping mask. I've had one mask before that was super thick & padded, but it was actually more difficult to sleep with. Thicker is not always better! One side is satin and the side that is against your eyes is a soft, velour type fabric. The straps are a nice, thick elastic band which is adjustable with Velcro. I've purchased many sleeping masks which have a thin elastic band that is not adjustable at all. Those eventually get stretched out before the rest of the mask is worn out. This mask does a pretty good job of blocking the majority of the light. A little light can get through the area of the mask around the nose.

The loofah back and body scrubber sponge has changed all that for me from the second I used it. They are so easy to use and comfortable to hold. The belt-like portion is long enough where I can hold both handles and not feel strained or awkward but relaxed as I loofah away. The handles are very soft and braided. The belt is about 28 inches long and 3 1/4 inches wide. The loofah makes up about 11 inches in the middle. It's soft and not paper thin but kind of squishy and padded if that makes sense. It's put together very well, feels and looks of high quality. I've used other loofahs in the past that were very hard and actually hurt to use. I've been pleasantly surprised by these in the fact that they truly do give a gentle exfoliation. They feel nice and never too rough or scratchy. I absolutely love that these don't hurt because I honestly used to be scared of most loofah products. I also love that there are three of them in this pack. Not that I want to share cause I like them a lot although you could share with a spouse if need be. I suggest keeping them all to your self though because, well, they are very nice quality. I did receive a promotional product although my thoughts and opinions are always completely my own and unbiased.",1

Therefore, a good eye cream is a must! I decided that I should try out Cheeva Beauty's Nourishing Eye Repair Cream. The directions were simple enough. Just tap a small amount around the eye area until it absorbs. I like simple. It also has very pretty packaging! I love creams that come in cute little pots. They look so much better on my vanity. The eye cream itself has a scent that reminds me a bit of Dove conditioner. Nothing overwhelming either. It didn't cause me any irritation as a result of use and left my eyes feeling hydrated. Very nice.<br /><br />I'm including a list of ingredients for reference:<br /><br />Purified water, jojoba seed oil, apricot kernel oil, squalane, hyaluronic acid, phytonadiona, arnica Montana extract, oxido reductades, soybean protein, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexlglycerin, eriobotrya japonica extract.<br /><br />(I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)",1

One of the ingredients is orange blossom water so it has a very light, clean, floral type scent. The scent isn't strong but light and refreshing. I absolutely love the smell. The spray pump makes it easy to apply and the size is perfect to throw in my purse in case I need a little refreshing throughout the day. I don't have huge pores although in certain spots they are more noticeable like on the sides of my nose and upper cheek areas. I find this spray does a good job at making those pores look smaller and my skin look overall smoother. I was afraid this would make my skin appear shiny but it doesn't do that. It also isn't sticky at all. I have used it both under my makeup and over it. Both ways work just the same and just as well. The formula doesn't irritate my skin at all which is a huge plus. You do need to reapply this throughout the day but it does last for quite a few hours. I only applied it twice, once in the morning and once in the later afternoon to refresh it. Overall I really like this product. It smells great, is easy to use, and helps the texture/look of my skin. I did get this product with a discount/ promotion although my thoughts and opinions are always my own and unbiased.",1

I have been using this Stretch Mark Cream by Luxy Beauty Care for a couple of weeks now, and I have had some pretty decent results so far using this.<br /><br />I have stretch marks on my stomach, upper arms and around my bust. The stretch marks on my arms and bust are fairly small in size and more minor than the ones on my stomach. I have found that this cream is working well for my arms and bust, I am seeing progress in their visibility. On my stomach, the ones that I call my tiger stripes, they are a bit more stubborn. I think that if I use this cream for a while, and keep up my routine, results will come. I do recommend for those stubborn stretch marks to exfoliate the area a few times a week. This method in combination with this stretch mark cream has been my best friend!<br /><br />I give this 4 stars, it is a great product, and one that I definitely recommend giving a shot if you want to treat your stretch marks.

I now have this as my daily night time cream that I use after my shower.<br /><br />I have been using this for a few weeks straight, and I have noticed that my skin has become much more radiant, the dry spots are clearing up, and my skin just looks so much more youthful. I have noticed that my breakouts are becoming less and less as well. It seems that all the new products that I am using just seem to be working together perfectly.<br /><br />Now about the cream itself. It is very light, and doesn't take long at all to absorb into the skin. It dries and doesn't leave any heavy greasy feeling, or any residue.<br /><br />I cannot comment on this for anti-aging, or anti-wrinkles because I am only in my late 20s and don't really have that issue yet.

Other active ingredients are derived from coconut oil and glycerin, excellent emollients and skin-repairing ingredients due to the medium chain fatty acids that skin can utilize to repair its surface and resist moisture loss; they also have an anti-inflammatory effect that reduces the risk of irritation.<br />- DOCUMENTED CLINICAL STUDIES - Studies based on the use of a 5% concentration of Argireline in volunteers showed that wrinkles around the eyes decreased up to 17% after 15 days of treatment and up to 27% after 30 days of treatment. Controlled studies have also demonstrated that wrinkle depth can also be reduced in the forehead. Our formula has 8%, the high end recommended for optimal results.<br />- NO HARMFUL INGREDIENTS - No parabens, bpa, phthlates, mineral oil, alcohol, sodium benzoate, propylene or any other toxic ingredients. All contents are compared to the EWG's Skin Deep Database for safety and compliance.<br />- MADE IN THE USA in our GMP (good manufacturing practices) and FDA certified facility; 100% fragrance free, 100% cruelty free, 100% manufacturer's money back guarantee.<br /> - Reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, reduce the appearance of under-eye bags, increase skin firmness and smoothness, repair and refresh skin surface, ideal for all skin types.<br />Paloma Perfect Peptide contains a highly concentrated 8% (by volume, not an 8% solution) of this ingredient, one of the highest available on the market, and recommended by the ingredient creator.

After cleansing and toning, apply one or two pumps as needed, each about the size of a pearl, to face, neck and decollete. A 30 ml bottle will last 45-60 days.<br />As I age I pay special attention to those fine lines around my eyes and keeping any forehead lines at bay by using the best of the best anti aging formulas available. I have also learned how critical it is to moisturize and care for the neck and decollete area. These areas are so often overlooked but they are two areas that can really reveal your age or make you look older than you really are. I also notice an increased firmness and smoothness in my skin.

It is good for skin but I used this on my hair. I have kinky curly, afro textured hair and it can get dry if left untreated. I don't have trouble finding products that can moisturize my hair. I even make my own oil blends to help keep my hair moisturized. This oil gave my hair a nice sheen (my type of hair does not shine it is too textured for that) when used between washings. When I used on freshly washed hair before I set it and then styled it the next day, it made my hair feel soft and silky. I can honestly say this is the first product that ever made my hair feel silky. For that alone I give this 5-stars.

On par with High End Brands!,"When it comes to primer, I've tried a ton of different brands, from high end to drugstore brands, but I always goes back to the same one. I'm very particular about primer, especially when it comes to how it feels on my face and the texture of it.  I was interested to try this, but it was going to take a lot to really impress me.<br /><br />One thing that will turn me off from a primer immediately is the smell.  I don't like my primers to have a strong smell or anything like that, and right away I was pleased with the way this smells. I really liked the texture of this. I've found that most primers that work really well tend to have this texture, it's definitely thicker than a lotion and isn't runny at all.<br /><br />Obviously the true test is how well does your makeup hold up??? Well, I worked a 10 hour shift and my face makeup still looked amazing, which is saying a lot during the summer! In fact, I kind of hope they make an eyelid primer, because as you can see in the picture my eye makeup did NOT hold up as well as my face makeup did!<br /><br />My favorite primer happens to be a high end primer that generally tends to &#34;smash&#34; the competition, but I would say this primer is on par with that primer, and I love the addition of the vitamin E!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.",1

It actually did as it claimed. My hair was smooth and the spot at the base of my skull that always gets missed no matter how hard I try, was also smooth and untangled. I am really shocked.

It has excellent hydrating effects that really benefit me being that I have such intensely dry skin at times. I'm always interested in exploring new skincare options, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works!<br /><br />It came with a convenient pump top for easy application. Pump tops are great because they dispense just the right amount of serum to apply. It's very easy to use. I just apply it to my entire face and neck, morning and night, after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing.<br /><br />It feels immediately hydrating once I apply it, and I really like the soothing sensation of well hydrated skin. It hasn't caused me any irritation as a result of use either, which is awesome. I like the quality and how soft and hydrated it leaves my skin feeling. I would definitely buy again.

Forget the ped-egg, it stays sharp for about a minute. Real women use blades! Caution, go lightly the first time, and always on WELL SOAKED tootsies.

I used the recommended dosage, and it just had such a strong taste that I couldn't keep it on my teeth for more than 5 minutes. However the next few uses I played around with the amount of gel that I used. I finally found the right amount that covered all of my teeth, but wasn't to the point where it was spilling out and getting into my mouth.<br /><br />The trays that they provide are nice, and they were easy to shape and mold to my teeth. I simply put them in some hot hot water, let them sit for a few seconds, then popped them in my mouth and bit down. They are very sturdy, and super easy to clean!<br /><br />I have been using this for 3 weeks now, and I am starting to see some really nice results. I started noticing a minor change within the first 5 uses. Because I lowered the amount of gel I am using, I assume that I may have to use this a bit longer than normal to get full results, but that doesn't phase me at all. My teeth are getting whiter! One huge plus is that my teeth experience 0 sensitivity during or after treatments. I tend to be wary of teeth whitening treatments because my teeth are quite sensitive, but this gel doesn't bother my teeth at all!<br /><br />Overall I am a big fan of this kit, and I am still using this product as we speak!

I can usually tell in the morning, if it's going to be a bad leg day and I will immediately reach for a compression and a knee brace and I will be good for the day, with only a couple doses of Tylenol throughout the day.<br />This compression from Copper Compression just about covers my whole leg and has copper in the compression and for some reason, that added copper just makes the difference between me taking Tylenol I guess because I haven't needed to take any Tylenol while wearing this and one of their braces on top of it. I have never tried anything with copper in it on my leg, but I have noticed the difference between this and just a regular compression from the drug store!<br />Rain is the worse for my leg, and if you suffer like I do, I would highly recommend Copper Compression!<br />Disclosure: I received this product complimentary for review purposes.

That is where tinted moisturizers come in. It is hard to find one with zinc oxide in it.

The oil is initially applied with dry hands on your dry face, but you add water to your skin and that emulsifies the oil and makes it look and feel pretty much like soap. This cleanser leaves no residual oil on my face at all.  In fact, it actually leaves my face a little dry as compared to my usual cleanser.  Also, while it removes most of my mascara, I still need to use my Lancôme eye makeup remover to get rid of the last traces of non-waterproof mascara under my eyes.<br /><br />This cleansing oil comes in a nice bottle with a pump that works well. It doesn't cause me any rash or irritation. This does have fragrance, but even though I can get headaches or allergic reactions to fragrance this one doesn't bother me. I think this is a nice cleansing oil that will work well for most skin types- except I wouldn't really recommend it if you have dry skin like me.

I felt like it really dried my skin out, but after using it for a week, I think my skin has adjusted and I enjoy it. The sensation of cleansing with an oil is a little bit dfferent. You apply it to a dry face and then add water as you continue to massage and cleanse the skin.<br /><br />It sounds strange, but the scent reminded me a bit of berry flavored children's cough medicine. Not entirely sure why, but it wasn't an unpleasant smell. The pump applicator made it easy to use.

I have limited counter space for my cosmetics and beauty products. Prior to ordering this organizer, I had all of my lipsticks & lip glosses shoved in a small drawer. Because they were over crowded, I had difficulties finding the ones that I wanted when I wanted them. Now I can easily see most of my lip products at a quick glance. The organizer is only 6 inches wide and 4 inches deep, so it doesn't take up a whole lot of counter space. The acrylic is sturdy & solid and is easy to clean. Recently I have been looking at acrylic organizers recently in my local stores and they seem to be over priced! This one is bargain!! My teenage daughter tried to claim this one from me, but since it is such a reasonable price, I will probably just go ahead & order her one, too.<br /><br />****Update - I ended up ordering another style of the Marrywindix acrylic organizer for my daughter. This one has drawers in addition to storage on top for brushes & bottles. She LOVES it! It is very well made and looks great!

Especially when things are stressful or it's just that time of the month. I had some friends tell me that mud masks are especially helpful for this, but that they are also good for exfoliating and keeping skin healthy. I tried using some bentonite clay as it says you  can use it as a mud mask, but it ended up clumpy and hard to spread on my face. I always ended up making too much too, which only wasted it. It was too much trouble and I stopped using it. I decided to give the dead sea mud mask a go. It is much darker than I expected, my entire face was blue/grey. It's very easy to spread on, I just used one finger and small swisp on each section of my face. It doesn't take too much, I figured it would take a big scoop, but really it took much less. I have used it three times already, each before bed, and you can't even see a dent in how much was in the jar. I left it on about 10 minutes each time and then wiped it off with a wet wash cloth.

The ends are usually dull and they have a hard time grabbing anything. I was extremely happy when I opened this pack of 3. They are a sturdy stainless steel metal, no plastic or cheap aluminum. The ends of the silver one are extremely pointy, perfect for pulling out things like splinters and anything that might get stuck in the skin. My husband was working and ended up with a large splinter under his finger nail. Since you can't exactly get it from the top, we decided to use the silver sharp pair of tweezers and were able to extract the splinter from under his nail. They also work very well for removing hair. I pluck from time to time and the black and pink pair are really nice for that. The silver is easy to get out any ingrown hairs.

AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B00WQEJV6M,5,2015-09-20 04:09:04.000,"What contouring is and isn't, and why this is a great brush to use for it","In my younger days, I used to model, so I became an old hand at contouring, which seems to have been revived a la Kim Kardashian. One of my favorite brushes from then was a flat contouring brush that was angled. I absolutely adored it for adding the right shadow under my cheekbones to make them stand out.<br /><br />Since the contouring revival, I decided to give this a go again, but I couldn't find a reasonably priced brush that did what I wanted it to do (I refuse to spend a fortune on a brush for this, mostly because I do not see contouring lasting very long, but that's another review.) The HDSL brush came closest to what I was looking for: dense, flat and with a good handle.<br /><br />It kind of looks like a paint brush, but the hair is VERY nice. Very soft and dense, and a miracle for something that's less than six bucks. My contouring skills are such that I know not to buy an entire palette of colors that are way too orangey or warm. I use Kevyn Aucoin's contour powder which is way pricey (you can find something similar in color in Makeup Forever's eyeshadow line), but the Aucoin contour powder color was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />As I'm sure you know, contour is meant to mimic a shadow. It is NOT a bronzer (you cannot contour with anything with the slightest bit of shine); too orange and you look ridiculous. The color is a light matte taupe with zero hint of red in it. It should NOT be too dark, unless you are dark complected. Think of it as being two shades darker than your skin color, the way a shadow is cast on the hollows or low areas of your face.<br /><br />This brush picked up the powder like a champ and deposited it nicely. Does a great job fading the contour color out so it looks like a shadow and not like I have a swath of dirt on my face. My only hesitation with this so far is that I wish it was angled, but no matter. It's not that hard to use in such a way (well, what do you want for less than six bucks?)<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this. You won't get anything better at anywhere near the price.",1

This is a smooth, creamy, nice-smelling product that seems to really and truly be helping my cellulite. I am 5'2&#34; and I weigh a firm, fit, muscular 125 pounds. I am also 43 years old and a mother of 3. Being as small as I am, I expected a few stretch marks with my pregnancies. I actually got lucky and ended up with very few stretch marks, but I did earn a little cellulite in my belly. Particularly around an old scar from where I had my appendix out at age 15. For whatever reason, this scar has become decidedly attached to some very stubborn fat cells. No matter what exercises I do, or how much cardio I do, this little scar retains a firm hold on an ugly little bubble of cellulite, and it's one of the few places I got a handful of stretch marks.<br />I have tried tons of products over the years, and never had much success. Now, I'm not saying this product is a miracle, because it isn't. My cellulite and stretch marks didn't disappear over night, or even in a week. But I have noticed some improvement, and I'm certain it isn't wishful thinking. I never hold much hope for any of these products, so that I'm never too disappointed. Also, I've stared in the mirror at this ugly little place on my body for years now. There has definitely been improvement.<br />This cream also makes my skin soft, and that's always a plus.

The ferrules are strong on them and are not loose at all. I love every single brush in this set. I can easily create an every day eye look or a more drastic smokey eye with the brushes included. I love the tapered blending brush in this set. It is the perfect size. The angled contour brush is perfect for applying blush, highlight, or contouring. The brushes all pick up a good amount of powder and don't waste much or create a lot of unnecessary fallout. While washing the brushes I didn't lose tons of hairs either which was great. The brushes cleaned very well and maintained their normal shape and softness after drying. So far I am very happy with this brush set and highly recommend it.

It beat ROC products for me.,"I received a complimentary bottle of this serum to review on my blog. I really love it. I had finished my old retinol serum, which I liked and was ready to purchase another bottle until I was asked to review this serum on my blog. I like that this product is light. It has the same lightness as OZ Natural's hyaluronic serum. A little goes a long way. Two pumps of the serum is the most you will need. The serum absorbs quickly into the skin. Allow a full minute to go by before you apply another product over it. That initial absorption you see is just ti drying faster on the top layer of skin. It takes about a minute for serums to absorb deeper into the skin. Allowing this time prevent the pilling when you a moisturizer too soon.<br /><br />Give this product about four weeks to see any real results. Retinol products take months of use to see any impact on deeper issue like lines and wrinkles. Initially you will feel a surface difference where skin my feel smoother or even softer. A couple of weeks later you may see some lighter scars fading. If you are battle crow feet apply a little of this serum at the corners of your eyes (don't get the product in eyes though) before you apply your eye cream. The two working together will give you better results.",1

And 2 compliments from friends after using it for 1 week,"I bought this to begin (and win!) the fight against the wrinkles that are appearing around my eyes (crow's feet). I guess the best solution is not to laugh, but then what fun would life be...<br /><br />What is Hyaluronic acid? According to WebMD, &#34;Hyaluronic acid works by acting as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and other tissues. In addition, it might affect the way the body responds to injury.&#34;<br /><br />(+) Does it work? I've used the Hyaluronic serum every night for a week now. Not sure if I can say 100% that I have noticed no fine lines around my eyes, but I've had 2 friends remark that my skin is looking great. As we women know, that's a good endorsement right there.<br /><br />(+) Texture: As you can see in the photo, the Derma-nu serum is a clear, slightly viscous consistency that goes on clear. You can feel it on your skin for quite a few minutes afterwards. It does NOT leave your skin feeling greasy (big pet peeve of mine) when you wake up in the morning.<br /><br />(+) Smell: This is not a scented beauty product. There is a very slight almost medicinal scent - that's the best way to describe it. It is not unpleasant, it is extremely mild, but it smells like it has some ingredients that 'have a purpose', vs. beauty products that have fragrances added.<br /><br />(+) Packaging and ease of use: The pump is well made - it dispenses a small amount of serum, which I am finding is enough for applying to the corners of both eyes. I'm having to &#34;prime&#34; the pump about 2-3 times before it dispenses the serum, so be careful, you don't want to double pump the serum unless you are OK putting possibly 2x the amount on your face than you might have intended.<br /><br />(+) A little goes a long way. I travel a lot, so the compact bottle and efficient dispensing from the pump are bonuses for me.<br /><br />(/) Organic. The bottle indicates that 72% of the ingredients are organic. It doesn't clarify which of the ingredients are/are not organic. It would be nice to see this get to 100%.<br /><br />Bottom line: So far, my skin has felt good, I've had a few compliments, and I'm pleased with the way Derma-nu packaged the Hyaluronic serum so that it is easy to dispense.<br /><br />*I received the serum for evaluation and review",1

So this is something I will want on hand at all times as it is very healing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",1

They all say they will make your wrinkles or crows feet shrink or smooth out or give your 40 something face a &#34;youthful&#34; glow again. At best, these products moisturize, cleanse, and some provide some protection from sun exposure damage.<br /><br /> This serum from EB5 makes the usual claims, of course, but it's not as outrageously expensive as so many of the other brands. It's a creamy concoction and it takes very little to cover my entire face - the instructions say just use one pump and that is sufficient. There's a faint scent that makes me think of Asian food - I guess that's the sesame seed oil,but the scent fades quickly. It takes about ten minutes to fully absorb into my skin, so I am not using this immediately before going to bed. I haven't had any skin irritation or breaking out in a week. Nor have I noticed any visible difference in the overall condition of my skin and no &#34;plumping&#34; in my laugh lines. My face is soft and it feels just a moisturized as when I use only my regular moisturizer.

It's actually found in high quantities in the skin of a baby, which everyone knows is incredibly soft.<br /><br />This product, applied to your face, will protect it from UV damage, improve elasticity, make your face feel softer, and properly moisturize it.<br /><br />I have ben using products by Derma- nu for a while and this is my second buy of this serum. Do proper research before you buy products that you're going to put on your face to be seen everyday. I did, and I found this reliable product. The greatest thing is that it works with almost every skin type be it oily, dry, or combination. This is terrific because my skin is very, very combination and while parts of my face are dry, some are a little more oily. This balanced everything out very nicely , that's why I am getting the second bottle of the same one.<br />As they stated  that &#34;This Formula Has Been Infused with Vitamin C + Vitamin E + Green Tea Extract For Their Superior Anti Aging Benefits&#34;. I used to make my own masks with vitamin E, green tea and many other ingredients but it just takes too much time to mix it yourself. I alternate this serum with Derma-nu other serum to balance it. My skin is visibly better now.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, just buy it anyway. It's not expensive for what it does, and if you don't like it just get your money back with the 100% guarantee.

As I can fill it in no time.  There are different slots for different brushes.  It holds the brushes well and in place and I think because of them being upside down makes them dry faster and help hold their shape.

This roller calmed my skin right down.

Ummm, I guess I'm not as fair as I thought; they aren't kidding when they say 'fair'! This is Caspar white!<br /><br />No matter. I mixed a bit of foundation in a more human shade in with the Boo-Boo, and my bruise was history (or at least until I washed my makeup off.) Very nice cover-up, no creasing, no caking, and it didn't move all day. The only issue I had, aside from how light the lightest shade was, is that it did such a good job of covering up the bruise it made the surrounding skin look naked (this is a VERY full coverage item.) Just be aware of that when you buy it.<br /><br />And take them at their word for the color! I'm probably somewhere between light and medium in the Boo-Boo universe.

The bottom of the jar has an unfitting sticker that says Best Neck Firming Cream, 2 oz. With Hyaluronic Acid, Coenzyme (CoQ10), Licorice, Vitamin C, and other ingredients which appear to be scribbled out. The writing on the sides of the jars is ridiculously small and the words are blurred to the point where they are unreadable.I can read the directions (apply to face and neck) but I dislike being unable to read the ingredients and manufacturing information. As far as the product itself goes, this is a terrific basic tightening/softening cream. Its texture reminds me of Desitin Diaper Rash Ointment (and it smells a bit like Desitin), but it does get absorbed into skin.  The first time I applied this, I generously &#34;coated&#34; my neck, and once coated, this becomes a soft of collar of skin smoothers and plumpers.

AH3KEDBPWJGL24RNC6VTJOJGYXSA,B0163GB1NE,5,2016-01-08 11:38:37.000,Pleasant change of pace from the Clarisonic,"I'm very big into skincare. Way before I got a Clarisonic, I used scrubbing sponges for daily exfoliation. This facial cleansing pad is a new one to my skincare arsenal. It seems to be a take on various Korean modes of skin cleansing that are currently popular.<br /><br />First off, let me say this sponge is very soft, much softer than anything I've ever used for exfoliating on my face. But while it's soft, it does a great job of getting rid of dead skin cells without stripping your skin raw. The outer surface feels almost silky, but when you put your fingers in and slightly stretch it to keep it on for use, the stretching opens up the cells in the surface and reveals a very effective, yet gentle, exfoliating mechanism.<br /><br />It's very easy to use, and very easy to clean - it comes with a silken loop to hang it for drying (it dries quickly.) All in all, I like this a lot. It's a nice change from daily Clarisonic use, one my skin truly appreciates. I'd definitely  put this on my 'must buy' list if you're serious about skincare.<br /><br />(I received a sample of this item to facilitate my honest and unbiased review.)",1

But I still want to get rid of them completely, if possible, for sure.<br /><br />I’ve used topical lotion to get rid of cellulite in the past and some worked and others no so much.  So, I wasn't sure what kind of results this cream will deliver.  Most of the review shows awesome results and I wanted to try this cream.<br /><br />It's been a month since I start to use this.  I am pretty sure every skin/body types react to cream differently and some may show results sooner and others may take longer.  Unfortunately, I have skin type that takes while to get used to the product.  As expected, this cellulite cream does work, but not as fast as some reviewers indicated.<br /><br />On 3rd week of using this cream, my cellulite does look less noticeable.  I did what I call &#34;pinch test&#34; (pinch my skin and see if skin dimples, how the dimple looks - pronounced, slight or none, etc) and skin looks much smoother.  I believe it would get rid of them if I continue using this cream.<br /><br />This is very thick cream. Even if it isn't for the cellulite, it smells good and it make my skin soft.<br />Also, I didn’t shower or bath at least hour after I applied cream. I think I have body type that takes longer to see the results than other people. I still have about 1/3 left in the jar, so I will keep using it until it is gone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received sample box of this item from seller to check out and write my personal opinion.

These brushes come enclosed in a nice case that has an individual slot holder and a flap that protects the bristles.  The case can then be rolled over and tied for easy carrying and storage for your brushes.  I have used all of these brushes and found that each brush seems to be soft bristles, and designed to do different makeup applications.  Love each of these brushes.  Although the brushes werent super saturated with makeup, I went a head and washed them to test the durability of the bristles.  Once washed with a mild brush wash they dried nicely and the bristles remained soft and I had no fibers falling out of the brush.  Each brush handle is wood and painted pink.  Love the girly factor.  Handles fit in my hand well and I had no issues with makeup application..<br />I received a beauty sponge.  It worked well with liquid foundation application ( just remember to wet and squeeze the water out of it before using) the sponge is super absorbent so if not wet it will absorb the makeup just like any beauty sponge.<br />This sponge is nice and soft and washed up well also.<br />Overall I am very satisfied with this set of brushes.  Bristles are soft and provide great makeup application.

AET76WSAMU5NAFN6XTEBGJGDXD3A,B0169Y84JE,5,2016-01-18 05:09:06.000,Great serum that really works!,"We are all searching for the fountain of youth! Okay I don't want to look old and wrinkled!  The description very much interested me so I decided I was ready to try it here!!  I've never tried anything from the dead sea and when I read that the product was made within a few miles of the Dead Sea, with no mineral degradation during transport.  I was anxious to give it a try. I try all sorts of things to keep that youthful glow of the skin but I also am selective about what I apply to my skin. Everything was natural here though, and It is not tested on animals, contains NO Alcohol, Sulfate or Parabens and is non- toxic.<br /><br />The product came in a 1.1 fluid ounce moisturizing serum. This product contains Glycerin and essential Dead Sea Minerals, known for their exceptional hydroscopic attributes and as a source of beautifying minerals. I read that in the description and thought what in the world is hydroscopic...so I looked it up.  &#34;Hygroscopy (etymology and pronunciation) is the ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment. This is achieved through either absorption or adsorption with the absorbing or adsorbing substance becoming physically changed somewhat.&#34; They perform synergistically (which means together with) Squalane, Dunaliella Salina Extract, Jojoba Seed Oil and Wheat Protein to help increase the skin's moister levels and diminish water loss for a more vital and glowing overall look. After reading that in the description and researching what some of the terms meant, I decided to put the product to the test.  I have aging sking that is somewhat problematic with large pores and a few minor areas of sagging skin.  I read clearly in the description that Genesea Perfecting Serum helps to disapate the signs of skin aging such as fine lines, wrinkles and sagginess and that you would see effects of the serum in five minutes.<br /><br />I've been using the serum for a good while now sometimes under makeup and every night before going to bed at night on clean dry skin. The serum is of excellent quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't react against or burn the skin. I don't have a problem with it leaving my face greasy or shiny and it quickly absorbs into the skin within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming and suppleness of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too taut. There is no build up or product residue left on the skin at all. This product has a nice smell, light and kind of floral smelling,  but no bad smell at all.  It is quite easy to use with an pump dispenser for the serum. I always prefer a pump dispenser as it keeps the integrity of the product by keeping air and contaminants out.  A little of the serum goes a long way, and the product is lasting a good long time.<br /><br />This product really hydrates my skin and make it look nice and firm almost immediately. This serum  really works and is reducing wrinkles and fine lines I have starting in my skin. The skin on my face looks so much more supple.  It also seems to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. My skin also looks clearer with less break outs and skin problems. I use the serum on clean skin of the face and I let it soak in. I also add the serum all over my face, and under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness and last I add a good moisturizing cream. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the serums and cream soak in. The face serum contains ingredient that keep your skin smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />It seems to me that the manufacturers of the product have researched and thought out the effects of this product and have provided a great combination of products to promote beautiful skin. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried appear to be working very well for me.",1

It's very drying so on the other end there's another lip applying thing to put a goopy, never drying gloss over it. Then after about an hr, your lips look cracked, even if not.<br /><br />I received this today. I can't explain it but to have something on my lips whenever seeing myself in a mirror is a 1st.

I'm a klutz using lipsticks like this anyway. The sponge on a stick. And now must be EXTRA careful applying it because it's the opposite problem now.

My hair is extremely dry after washing and letting it air dry (even though I always add a leave-in and oil). So, I decided to use this to help moisturize and twist my hair. I could just feel my hair going from super dry to extremely soft and moisturized from just one application of each section! I also applied this over castor oil, which I applied to my hair beforehand. (I use the L.O.C. moisturization method).<br /><br />I then twisted my hair and applied this generously (my twist outs always come out better when I'm more generous with my product of choice). After 10 hours or so, I took out my twists and had a very well-defined twist out! There was absolutely no frizz - even after separating each twist (I undo the twist and the split each section in half). I'm really happy with the results.<br /><br />The pics I'm included are of a two-day-old twist out  (I forgot to take a pic on the first day) and my hair still looks great - a little frizzy from sleeping on it, but nothing horrible. I just spritzed on a little leave-in conditioner to refresh my hair and it looked just as good as the first day. This cream is wonderful and allows me to easily go 4-5 days on one twist out - something that many other products just don't do for my hair.<br /><br />This has a really sweet, pleasant smell to it. It's a white cream that's on the thick side, but very easy to work with and absorbs nicely into the hair - doesn't just sit on top. I also love that it doesn't make my hair feel all crunchy or crispy. My twist out was really soft and my curls were bouncy. Thanks to providing great hold, amazing definition, and complete hydration for dry, frizzy hair, you can't get wrong using this product!<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review.

The first Mia Adora product I've used is their tattoo effect liquid eyeliner pen, which I highly recommend. This mascara is a beautiful true black. Often times mascara will dry to a much lighter shade after application, this isn't so with this product. This doesn't flake off like my other mascara that I was using up until I got this. The description says it's for short thin lashes, but it works nicely on my lashes which are pretty long. Often times I find that mascaras can't cover the entire length of my lashes without flaking off at the ends. This works just as well as a forty five dollar mascara that I once splurged on. Over the decade that I've been using mascara I've come to the conclusion that the super expensive mascara seem to work the same as regular priced mascara. Also a huge plus for me is that this mascara doesn't run when my eyes water from the cold winter winds. I have very sensitive skin and eyes, so far I have not noticed any sensitivity or other adverse reactions. Very happy with this mascara. I'm certainly falling in love Mia Adora cosmetics!

AEEO4SJ4MMZH2GD3NY56GLGO3VEA,B01A5YXRX2,5,2016-01-24 20:08:44.000,A tasty alternative to table salt...,"I like that this salt contains additional minerals and other nutrients I need. About ten years ago, I stopped using salt at the table. Because of a family history of hypertension, I wanted to start lowering my sodium intake, and just start a few healthier eating habits, in general. I used to sit at the table and sprinkle salt on my food before I'd even tasted it, and I just thought it was a terribly unhealthy habit and that it was time for a change. I'm not sure of all its health benefits of this pink Himalayan salt, or how significant they are, but I like the flavor. The kid in me loves the pretty pink color, and while I know, rationally, that it has no bearing on the flavor, I can't help but enjoy the way it looks in the shaker, with its grains of different shades. I tasted a bit upon opening the bag. To me, it doesn't have as strong a salty taste as regular table salt does, and it dissipates more rapidly on the tongue. In use with cooking, I also feel it's not as salty as my normal variety. It does a great job of allowing my other spices to do the work, and the seasoning blends I use can be better appreciated. I've also found that if I accidentally get a bit heavy-handed with this salt, it's more forgiving, since it's not as salty. Overall, I'm enjoying the way it looks and tastes, and my next experiment will be making my own body scrub. I was able to purchase this Himalayan pink salt at a discounted rate in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review.",1

After all, no one wants to look older or tired. I try all kinds of skin care products and really work hard at keeping my skin in good shape, so I decided I'd give this a try.I was speaking to a friend of mine recently whose skin always looks gorgeous. I asked her what she did to look so good? She is considerably older than me, but has no wrinkling and very pretty skin. She told me that she visits a dermatologist regularly and that she uses a retinol cream and that she pays 60.00 for just a small tube, plus the cost of the doctor visit. Now I am not sure of the strength of the retinoI cream she is using is, and I noticed this is 2.5% so I think that's a pretty effective dosage.The product came in a 1.7 fluid ounce moisturizer. I noticed that the retinol moisturizer also had Vitamin E & B5, Green Tea, Jojoba Oil, Propolis and shea butter. So I thought about Vitamin A or retinol and what it does for the skin. Vitamin A stimulates and thickens the dermis where collagen, blood vessels and elastin are thereby reducing wrinkles and increasing blood flow to the surface of your skin. Vitamin A actually expands the deposit of collagen in the skin; therefore slowing down the normal aging breakdown of your collagen and elastin. I've also read when studying skin care (and I really researched it) that Vitamin A increases blood flow and reduces the symptoms of rosacea, helps heal wounds more quickly, repairs cells in the skin and optimizes UV protection, exfoliates to make the skin more smooth, supple and even and even decreases melanin granules reducing brown spots and pigmentation. Vitamin A decreases sebum (oil) thereby treating acne very well and even helps with the eradication of precancerous lesions of the skin and improves hydration. Skins miracle healer!My mother has always used vitamin E. She is in her 70's and still has beautiful skin and is very selective about what she puts on her skin. I've read that Vitamin E has been used in skincare for so long that it sometimes gets passed over for newer, more exotic-sounding ingredients that are sometimes advertised or added to products. But Vitamin E is a highly beneficial ingredient, a strong defense against free radicals and the damage the environment does to the skin. When it’s combined with other antioxidants, It is an exceptional line of defense for your skin.The product is very good quality with no redness, burning itching or negative side effects. It doesn't leave your face shiny or greasy and seems to absorb within just a couple of minutes. I notice an immediate firming of the skin but no discomfort or a feeling of being too tight. There is no build up or product residue. This product has a  nice smell, light and soothing, and is quite easy to use. It's good that the items come in a pump, because exposure to air effects good quality ingredients. A little goes a long way, and the product seems to be lasting a good long time. I use many of Majestic Pure products, and I have had excellent luck with them all and no issues. This moisturizer already is reducing fine line and wrinkles in my skin. It really helps to keep down oiliness and shine off my face. I use this moisturizer on clean skin and I let it soak in, and use under the the throat and jaw line for added firmness. While I am applying my eye makeup, I let the cream soak in. This anti aging skin cream keeps your skin supple and moisturized. So far no complaints or problems and all the products I've tried and it works well for me. I am not affiliated with any supplier or manufacturer of goods.",1

It also doesn't have much of a scent either. So far I *think* I might be seeing a little fading of my burn scars, but it's not very obvious.

The bag fits in my purse without taking up space.<br /><br />Using these are a tad sticky and long lasting also waterproof. The color dries in under 60 seconds. The only way to get it off is with makeup remover or I use coconut oil. These lasted me a whole day without reapplying.<br /><br />The best part about having all these colors is you can do an ombre look, have a color to match all outfits. Also with these 24 colors, they range from lite to dark , which makes it perfect for all seasons.<br /><br />When I apply for best results I use a lite  color liner, chapstick and then apply color. I typically do 2 coats of color.<br /><br />I highly recommend these if you are looking for a set of matte color lipstick. These are perfect if you are a makeup artist or a lipstick addict. The price is reasonable.<br /><br />For people using mattes for the first time, it is going to be sticky at first before drying , so don't be disappointed with the texture.

They are easy and fun to use. This box of Anti-Aging sheet masks comes with 5 masks. Each mask is individually wrapped. When you open up a mask and remove it from the packing, you see that there are 2 layers. One is the sheet mask which is thin and papery like. The other is a plastic type material. The two layers are together, so I put both of them on my face. The other masks that I have used didn't have this plastic layer. I couldn't get it to lay flat on my skin very well, so I peeled the plastic layer off leaving just the paper one. This was what I was more familiar with. That layer was easy to mold to my face. The mask was very cold which felt refreshing. It's very wet - not to the point of dripping off my face, but enough that you want to spread it around more on the mask as it is on your face. It says to leave it on for 15-20 minutes. I opted for the lesser time because my coffee was ready & I didn't want to wait any longer for it! Then you are supposed to rub any left over &#34;goo&#34; (for a lack of a better word) into you skin. I accidently got a little into my eye, but it didn't burn or sting at all, which surprised me. I have very sensitive eyes and was expecting to feel some pain. I regularly use anti-aging products, plus I have only used one of these sheet masks so far, so I don't notice any difference to my skin, but I would definitely add this to my beauty routine.<br /><br />*I purchased these masks at a reduced price for the purpose of trying out & reviewing.

I have a love/hate feeling for the little raised &#34;dots&#34; that cover each side of the mat. I like them because they raise the hot tool when resting on the mat to give extra heat protection to my vanity top underneath it. However, I also put my makeup on at my vanity and because of the silicone surface, every little drop of makeup powder is attracted to and clings to the silicone mat surface. The silicone isn't that difficult to clean (I use either pledge spray or a lysol wipe), but the little raised dots make it difficult to get into all the little grooves in order to get the mat perfectly clean. I could move the mat while I put my makeup on, but I don't have many places to put it on where I get ready, so this would be a huge inconvenience. Plus, regardless of where i put the mat, it will still collect dust overtime and have the same cleaning issue.<br />As a solution to cleaning the mat, I started running it under warm water and using a dish brush with bristles to scrub the mat and get in those difficult grooves, which has been successful as far as perfectly cleaning the mat - it's just a little more tedious than I'd like it to be.",1

This is such a great value, this is a huge amount of African black soap. African black soap is always pretty pricey where I live so I'm very glad I can buy such a good amount here from Cleopatra's choice! I use African black soap as a facial and all over cleanser. Another thing I use African black soap for is cleaning my makeup brushes and sponges. I find that African black soap cleans even better than cleansers I have purchased specifically for cleaning make up brushes. I know it works well because it makes white makeup sponges look brand new! The only issue I had with this product is that the packaging didn't really hold up in transit, it arrived with a huge dent on it, though it may have happened before transit because nothing in the package could have made this mark. I have included a photo of the damage below. This in no way changes or reduces the products effectiveness.

AHGOODGQNJRKELF3UXX5RKJ5PSQA,B00XVYRQ1I,5,2016-02-18 06:46:36.000,Fantastic set of brushes that has a wide variety of brushes!,"[[VIDEOID:ee57af813ba86c8b2811225ae44f15f4]] I love makeup brushes and I own several sets of them so while I’m not an expert by any means, I do have quite a few sets to compare these to.  First, I absolutely love the color of these brushes.  Pink is my favorite color so I couldn’t resist this set of brushes.  Not only do these come in a super cute pink case, but they have adorable pink handles and quite a few of the brushes actually have pink bristles.<br /><br />There are 24 brushes included in this set so there are a wide variety of brushes.  This is a great starter or supplementary set of brushes.  The great thing about makeup brushes is you can use them however you want to use them, so this set of brushes will really cover any use.  I personally love the wide variety of brushes that are great for eye makeup.  I’ve really gotten into eye shadow and creating fun looks and having the right tools is extremely important and this set has pretty much every brush you could possibly need.<br /><br /> Each brush has a practical use, and there are four or five brushes that are great for face makeup as well. I really like the fan brush for highlighting and contouring.  There’s actually a smaller fan brush and a larger fan brush and both are great tools.<br /><br />The quality of these brushes is phenomenal.  I always wash my brushes as soon as I get them and I’ve gotten a few sets of poor quality brushes where as soon as you wash them the handles become loose and come apart due to poor quality, but these held up very well even when fully submerged in water.  The bristles also didn’t fall out while washing which is another sign of good quality.  Overall I love these brushes and I’m glad I was able to add them to my collection!<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.",1

I do have two issues. One is that four of the six sleeves are cracked in the corners, like it's old, dried out plastic but I guess it's nothing that some packing tape can't fix. I've never had this issue with the other five sets from them. The other issue is the holder feels a bit more foam like instead of the pleather like the previous ones. But those issues have absolutely nothing to do the stamping ability of the images which, in the end, is the most important thing!",1

Of coarse your plates and stamper have to be decent quality to pick up good images. It's not always the polish that might be the problem. Try different stampers before you give up. Some stampers work better with different plates and polishes. Hope this helps:)",1
AHETDGASODBTH5UNKJMMGGE6M25Q,B019NBEIKY,4,2016-02-23 04:05:05.000,This is a good set of contouring colors,"This is a good set of contouring colors.  It has a huge range of colors needed for dark skin, to light skin, It even includes a white cream for highlighting along with some green and pinks to even out skin tone.  Basically this set is a great set to start with and to have on hand for when your skin goes thru some funky changes.  We all have that happen from time to time.  Anyways my contouring kit is a cream set of 15 colors.  Each color is very creamy and I had no issues with blending and rubbing in.  However I always use a high quality primer with all makeup so that may add to the easy technique of blending into the mixture.  Each color has its advantages along with its disadvantages.  Like I said not every color is going to suit your needs so If you are looking for specific colors this is not the set for you, this is a range of colors for different shades of skin.<br />The makeup seemed to be long wearing but please dont forget that I used primer and that could have something to do with makeup wear length.  I also did not break out with this cream as I have done with so many other colors.  Of course I made sure to clean my face off each evening and I never slept in it at all.  The plastic holding the makeup tins is a hard black plastic,  I wouldnt call it super high quality but its not the cheapest I have come across.  The reason for 4 stars is because I prefer mirrors in the compact as sometimes I like to have my makeup in hand while applying and it would be nice if a mirror was included.  However it takes no value away from the makeup its just my personal preference.  I also need to research some of these ingredients,  (which I havent done as of yet while writing the review)  I have not recongized a couple and usually most ingredients I am somewhat familiar with as I am a makeup fanatic.  Nothing jumps out and screams do not put on your face though.  I also wish the ingredients was listed on the hard plastic case so once you dispose of the box which everyone does you still have a list of ingredients in case you have some delayed reaction after long term use.  Another reason for 4 stars.  However overall I am pleased with this makeup palette.  It seems to be well suited for a starter pack for those learning to contour, and those whose skin goes thru some weird skin tones from time to time.  My only complaints were the ones listed above and no others.  Makeup seems to spread smoothly and blends well.  Which is what most women prefer when it comes to contouring.  I did notice it did take several coats and more during application than what I am used to however compared to regular drug store kits its pretty comparable to it, may be a tad better in quality as it blends easily.<br />I received this makeup palette for free for testing and reviewing purposes,  I have come to this conclusion by using and wearing this makeup for a few days myself.",1

I actually purchased two Identical pair, except one was 6.5&#34; and one pair is 7.5&#34;. I wasn't sure which size would work for me, so I bought them both. I will give one pair to my daughter. I actually prefer the 7.5&#34; best for some reason, it just feels more balanced in my hand. Both pair cut equally well though.  I enjoy trimming my cut between visits and I'm pretty good at it.  It actually saves me a lot of money and allows me to visit the salon less often.  Also I sometimes trim my daughters hair and my boyfriends hair.  I have several  beauticians in the family (even though I am not) so I've learned the basics.  I got the scissors in quickly and packaged well.  The scissors fit my hand well, but I have smaller hands and fingers. I had no issues with that at all.  I also enjoyed that the scissors are crafted of fine stainless steel and are easy to manipulate. I purchased them for testing purposes. The pair I received open and close easily and with no issues.  The scissors were sharp and cut cleanly.  I am enjoying the scissors and believe they are a very good value. As I stated previously I am not a professional beautician, but for me, using the scissors at home they are perfect.  I have no complaints or issues and the product I've tried is working very well for me.",1

It does an exceptional job of breaking down mascara. The best part of this product comes from continued use! Eyelashes become darker, shinier and a lot healthier. I've noticed less breakage and fall down after introducing this product into my skin care routine. I'm hoping to see some growth soon. I gave up on trying to use one of those so-called miracle eyelash serums because it burned my eyes so bad. This Mia Adora oil does not burn if you get it in your eyes, it just makes your vision blurry for a while. I was fortunate to have purchased this item with a promotional discount for the purpose of testing and review. I like the way it effectively breaks down and removes eye makeup. It's gentle on the delicate eye area and it's fragrance free. You can use this oil as a conditioning treatment alone, just a drop or two for each eye, and the bottle will last you a good while.",1

It is designed very ergonomically and is very comfortable to hold during use. The tool is extremely lightweight and has a tapered design which makes it so comfortable to use. The instructions are to use it for a minute each morning and evening. It has illustrations which show you to spend 20 seconds on the right side and 20 seconds on the left side and 20 seconds on the T-zone. The tool will actually buzz gently when you should move to the next area. This is a great feature! It also comes with 3 brush heads; massage, sensitive and normal skin. I am using the sensitive for now and it is perfect for a gentle exfoliation. When I am finished with that minute, my skin just glows and feels so clean! Hopefully the heads do not need replaced quickly as I do not think they are yet available on Amazon or online. It also comes with a sleek charger that does not take up any room at all on the counter – this is important to me as I have a small bathroom. Also, the LumaRx comes with a very nice carrying case that will come in handy for an upcoming vacation.",1

The texture is nice and not too thick. Lathers up my hair nicely with a quarter size. Since I have a lot of hair, I have to use a quarter size or more. I scratch and rub my scalp for about 30-50 seconds before I rinse in a bucket. This helps me to clean my hair even better.

After a one-minute &#34;application&#34; with any one of the brushes, I love how smooth and clean this makes my face feel.<br /><br />The packages includes:<br /><br />- three brush heads (sensitive, normal, and massage) and their covers which have air vents to hasten drying<br />- one charging base with power cord<br />- one brush wand that operates at 3 speed levels<br />- one white plastic zippered travel case<br />- one instruction pamphlet<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The wand contains a rechargeable battery that last for 30 uses. The first charge takes up to six hours.  It also has a 30 minute fast-charge feature that will provide 4-5 uses. By the way, I love the charging light on the base; it has a &#34;cool&#34; factor to it.<br /><br />- There's a one minute timer that has what I call a &#34;tripacer&#34; (like Sonicare's quadpacer) timer built in for each of the three zones of the face. These zones are the T zone, left side, and right side. What this means is that the unit pauses ever so slightly ever twenty seconds to let the user know when it's time to move on to the next zone so that the cleaning time can be distributed evenly among zones.<br /><br />- None of the three brushes were rough or extremely abrasive. The rotating and vibrating brush heads were as gentle as could be and I have sensitive skin.<br /><br />- The wand with brush can be used in the shower as long as it's not fully submerged in water.<br /><br />- This can be used to remove cosmetics.<br /><br />- The unit comes with a 2-year limited warranty.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Although these brushes remove make-up effectively, I personally only like to use this on the days I do not wear makeup. The reason is that the eye area has to be avoided. I use eye makeup so I wind up washing my entire face with my hands instead as it does not make sense to me to use a brush on only part of my face.<br /><br />- There are a lot of don'ts in the manual like don't submerge in water, don't use around the eyes, don't use if you are taking steroid-based medication, don't operate outdoors or where there are aerosol products or oxygen being administered, etc.<br /><br />- If used daily at no more than the maximum two times per day, the brush heads need to be replaced  every three months. The Massaging head (since it doesn't not have bristles) can be replaced every six months. This can get expensive. I contacted the company for the replacement price and they said they would let me know when it's orderable on Amazon. I will update the comments section of this review with that information when I receive it.<br /><br />- The battery on this unit is NOT replaceable as per the email from them which I posted in the comments section of this review.<br /><br />At first I questioned why would I need such a facial cleansing tool. After using this, however, I realized that I love how it makes my face feel so clean and smooth. This is not a tool I would use more than twice per week since I really hate using this to remove makeup, however, it's so gentle on my skin that I look forward to the cleansing action, mildly exfoliating properties, and the light massage it provides me all without the use of a chemical masque.",1

I really never connected the thing is that I have pigmented lips, and because they pull red, any color always has a reddish cast to it. And definitely no pink lipstick, especially anything lighter than medium, ever looked right.<br /><br />I started looking around to see if there was some product I could use, since foundation is just drying and causes flaking. I was told that MAC makes a good lip coverup, but it's $20 (why is everything at MAC $20 and up?) I don't have a problem spending the money, but since there's no freestanding MAC store near me, I thought I'd give this Etude House concealer a try.<br /><br />And it's good. Unlike plain foundation, it's very glossy when you first apply it. It truly blots out your real lip color; it's like lip White-Out. In a mirror, you look like you're looking at a photo negative!<br /><br />This stuff is way too glossy to put anything over it without blotting. The dry down takes forever without blotting, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that once I blotted, the white out effect was still very much there, just not glossy, and so, ready for lipstick. The one thing it does really well  is block out the red of my lips and give my lip products a much truer color payoff.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out. The only caution I'd say is you don't need to put on as much of this as I did; you'll just be wasting product, and there's no dry down when you overdo it!",1

I took a before-after picture of my nose so you can see the results.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",1

And argan oil is one of the hottest products on the market to do just that. Unfortunately this product falls short. I've tried it multiple times with the same non- moisturizing result. It does state &#34;for all hair types&#34;. So i figured id try it on a few more than my own. Kinky, wavy/curly, and straight led to the same result. The argan oil must truely be lacking in this product. A conditioner is still very nessecary after using this shampoo. And that holds true for all the hair types ive stated above. It does however cleanse the hair well. But I feel with constant use will strip it of its natural moisture. This would be a product to use occasionally if you need a deep clean.

AGOJ45XJ42CHCMELYK7Z6EZNYE4Q,B01AMSFNBK,5,2016-03-27 03:31:15.000,Love this mirror! Great price & awesome quality!,"I recently stayed at a high end hotel that had a mirror just like this in every single room. I loved it so much that I came home after my travel and starting looking for one. I found them at several home type stores, but the cost was over a hundred for each one I found. I held off thinking eventually I will find one at a better price. I came across the Kenley Wall Mounted Magnifying Makeup Mirror on Amazon at half of what I had seen elsewhere.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to purchase the Kenley mirror at a promotional price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I immediately<br />jumped at the chance.<br /><br />The mirror came a few days ago. I waited till today to install when my husband could help me. The mirror came with almost everything you need to install the mirror - including the screws and anchors. For tools, we used a level and a cordless screwdriver. The installation instructions were easy to understand and they included drawings. We were able to install the mount in about five minutes.<br /><br />The mirror itself is very nice and well made. One side is regular and the other is 3 times magnifying. It is a chrome silver. There is a LED ring in the inside and in between the mirrors. It requires 4 - AA batteries. You have to unscrew one side of the mirror to install the batteries. It is easy to unscrew and screw back on. You do want to make sure that the mirror is screwed back on tightly. The LED lights are turned on my a switch on the outside of the mirrors.<br /><br />The LED light is great, with the combination of the either mirror. Plucking my brows was easier than ever before on the magnifying side with the LED light turned on. The mirror both turns and flips. The bracket has an extending arm, so that you can manipulate the mirror to wherever you need it to be. It folds up nicely to be stored against the wall. The mirror is also the perfect size for a mounted mirror. In my picture below you can see the mirror is size relation to an outlet in my wall.<br /><br />This is exactly what I wanted, from the moment I saw a similar mirror at the Hotel Philips in KS City. I strongly recommend it!",1

They alway me to enjoy my creative side, without the pain or lifetime commitment of real tattoos. AND I can change them often.  I have used the smaller kind many times, but this is my first time with a larger size.  When I got them and went to apply them, I noticed there were no directions in the package.  I took a chance that it was the same as the smaller ones I had used previously, so I remove the sticky clear paper and applied the tattoo with paper to my arm.  I took a damp paper towel and held it on the tattoo for about a minute.  I then slowly remove the paper backing.  It worked just fine.  I did have on little bubble in the design, but I pushed on it a little and it looked liked the rest of the tattoo. This has stayed on very well as I am going on about day 5 and it still looks great. The tattoo covered a good percentage of my upper arm, so it is definitely noticeable.  Overall, I am enjoying wearing my new tattoo and will be looking to see what other designs this company has.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for using it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.

AFB74G7T7I3UVC332XRKHCJ5TFJQ,B01AYTGWA8,3,2016-03-28 15:17:04.000,The All Natural way to remove nail polish!,"I'm puzzled by this product.  I loved the idea of having a natural, non-toxic nail polish remover.  I paint my own nails quite often, skipping the nail salon to save money and time.  I've been giving myself manicures and pedicures since 6th grade, so I'm pretty good at it (if I do say so myself) and am well-versed in many of the products out there.  I typically use a 100% acetone remover, which is AWESOME, but I hate that there are so many harmful chemicals, not only on my nails, but also in the fumes I'm breathing in every time I use it.  So, when I saw this product, I was excited and motivated to try it and like it.<br /><br />When it arrived, I was also pleased with the size.  I had assumed it would be pretty small because of the way the dropper looks next to it in the picture, but it's actually a good sized bottle.  Before using any product, I read the directions and particularly with a new type of product like this non-toxic, all-natural nail polish remover.  That's when I saw that you have to leave the product on the nail for 2-5 minutes.  I don't understand this because once you use the dropper to apply the product to the nail polish that's on the nail, it immediately starts dripping down the sides of the nails onto your hands and makes a bit of a mess.  It's also pretty inconvenient to sit there for 5 minutes when I could use my regular nail polish remover and would have clean nails in 30 seconds to a minute.  I decided instead to try pouring the product into a shallow bowl and soaking my nails in it instead.  This did make it much easier and created less of a mess, but it also requires you to use a lot more of the product than you would just using the dropper.<br /><br />I waited 2 minutes and took a cotton ball to swipe the nail to see if the polish would come off.  It started to, but just the top layer.  I re-soaked them in the product for 3 more minutes, and I was able to remove the polish from my nails.  I should also mention that I use Orly bonding base coat, which helps the polish adhere to the nail.  I also had 3 coats of polish, and a top coat, so that might be why the polish was so stubborn to come off.  Plus, it was a deep red, which is difficult to remove no matter what you are using, and it usually dyes my nail beds a bit when I'm removing the polish anyway.  As a positive, I did notice that this product was MUCH less harmful on my nails.  My acetone remover immediately dries out my nails and strips all the healthy oils from the nails and nail beds.  This did not do that.  My nails had a nice, healthy shine to them and the nail beds retained their moisture, which is nice.<br /><br />So, in summary, I love that this product is natural and non-toxic, but it's just not practical for me to spend 5 minutes soaking my nails to wait for the polish to come off.  However, if you are super green and more willing to commit to being patient in order to be able to use something that has no chemicals and is good for your body and those around you (which I commend you for!), then this is a great substitute for chemical nail polish removers.",0

Plus, it comes with a little sleeve to keep it in, which is convenient.<br /><br />It's really to use and has a nice, gridded handle so it doesn't slip out of your hands. I like the curved end that makes it really easy to push your cuticles. It has &quot;U.S.A.&quot; nice and big on it, too, for those who preferred products made in the U.S.A.

Although, gel polish does seem to last a bit longer on me so I may start wearing it more often.  This nail polish remover does work.<br /><br />I like that it is Non-Toxic and Bio Certified.  Acetone free is super, because I have less to worry about if it were to accidentally spill.  There really isn’t much of a scent from this product.  No harsh chemical smell, which my entire family was thankful!<br /><br />I tried it on standard nail polish and home gel polish.  It did eventually take both off, but I found that I really needed to soak and rub at the polish to get it off. This really isn’t an issue for me since it is a safer alternative.  I also like that it doesn’t leave my nails and cuticles all dried out. Instead it seems to provide n3eeded moisture.<br /><br />One thing that I don’t like is that it does not provide a complete list of ingredients that are contained in the product.  They state “proprietary” botanical mixtures.  I am apparently not allergic to anything in the mixture, but people are allergic to botanical substances!<br /><br />I did receive this Pure Body Naturals 100% Natural Nail Polish Remover for free in return fro providing my honest and unbiased opinion.",1

Anyway, normally I don't fool with pushing my cuticles because I'm always loosing the wooden pushers and they always go so dull after using them for a while. Well, now I don't have to keep buying those because this cuticle pusher is awesome and made out of stainless steal. It has a really awesome design, a very nice weight so that it stays in the hand and also can be used to clean out from under the nails too.<br /><br />I really do love using this though. I always give it a little wipe with an alcohol pad and then do what I need to do. I use the curved ended down to push my cuticles back and then use it face up to clean out from under my nails, because lets face it. It doesn't matter what you do, stuff is still gonna get up in there and you have to clean it out every so often.<br /><br />Anyway, works great and totally worth the price. Couldn't recommend this enough to everyone.",1

So I have to say that if you can't work with just string lashes then do not get these. However, if you don't mind then these are great. They look beautiful and blend in so well that people honestly can't tell they are false lashes.<br /><br />I honestly love them and they look very natural and beautiful.

I've been using it for a week, and the difference in my skin is amazing. Most of the cuts and cracks have healed, and all of the bumps between my fingers and on my palms have gone away. Based on other reviews, I was afraid this would make my skin feel like it's coated in something, but it doesn't. It's not completely waterproof, but it does help relieve the irritation from frequent handwashing. Before I go to bed, I put on a layer of lotion and then put a layer of this over the top. My skin stays nice and moisturized without the need to wear cotton gloves all night. I will be buying more of this!",1

So, I use hair Kleeva conditioner first, then  in a few minutes I wash it with Kleeva shampoo. Works much better than doing it other way. My family and I use more conditioner then we do shampoo in winter time. We use it to not only moisturize our hair but make it silky smooth so that there are no tangles and brushes slide right through. The first thing I noticed about our new conditioner was the nice bottle and great smell. Even though the ingredient list was confusing, I really liked the quality of the conditioner.<br /><br />  This conditioner  helps to restore your hairs strength. I have been using about a dab the size of a less than a  quarter in my hand and that is plenty enough to do my entire head. I have short hair. My kids have long hair. My oldest daughter uses flat iron. this conditioner helps her to keep her hair protected and shiny. I was provided this conditioner at discounted price to test and review. All opinions are my own.",1

I like to do my daughters nails, but find traditional nail polish remover to be very harsh, which is why I wanted to find a product that was 100% natural, but effective. This product is just as effective as traditional nail polish removers, but without the toxic smell. Furthermore, since this product is natural I am hoping it will not damage my nails like other nail polish removers I have used in the past that ended up being corrosive.

I have been using this product for several weeks now and I am very surprised at how soft and moisturized my skin feels. I also used it as a conditioner for my hair and was shocked at how soft and revitalized my skin felt. The ingredients in this body wash prompted me to use this product on my toddler and I am happy to state that the results were excellent. The body wash left my daughters skin soft and not irritated, which has occurred in the past with popular body washes. This product is made up of Tea Tree Oil, Coconut Oil and Argan Oil. I am not sure if anyone knows this, but another name for Tea Tree Oil is melaleuca. Melaleuca is known to kill bacteria, fungus and viruses. This is a very powerful anti-bacterial body wash that is absolutely worth the price.",1
AGRC3JDXRCSSQ6TOMEB66Y5ORIYA,B01COD9MPY,5,2016-04-10 17:38:02.000,Nice mirror for make up,"I have never been the type of girl to stand in front of a mirror and do make up for long periods of time. I have used a hand mirror for years, I prefer to sit somewhere like a bed or couch and do my make up. Using a hand mirror is harder though because you then only have one hand to work with the make up. While I don't do a ton, opening things like mascara or doing eye liner is a lot harder when you only have one hand.<br /><br />This mirror stands up on it's own, so you don't have to hold it. It has a pretty red exterior and it even lights up. The light is not a really bright one, but enough to light up your face if you are in a room that is not as bright as you would like. The rim lights up on both sides, the regular mirror side and on the zoomed in mirror side. There is a place to plug it in, but no plug, so you can choose that option if you have a plug. I used the 3 AAA batteries that it came with. It works well for me to be able to do my make up without having to stand in the bathroom and I don't have to hang onto a hand mirror.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

AESCAQQYIK3SYLMLRXPRNPKXIC4A,B01728D3RY,3,2016-04-11 18:39:37.000,Not suitable for thick and wavy hair,"I really loved the idea of this hair straightener brush, so I decided to give it a try. I straighten my hair just about every day and I have long, thick and naturally wavy hair. I am always on the hunt for easier and quicker way to do my hair. Ultimately, I am hoping to save some time off my busy morning routine because every minute counts. This brush heats up quickly and it is safer than flat irons simply because there is a lower chance of burning myself. However, I find this tool a little too heavy for me to handle and it is quite impossible for me not to touch those three buttons on the side of the device switching the temperature up and down while working on my hair. It leaves my hair fluffy and does not do a great job straightening the roots because there is only so close I can get to my head. I have to section my hair piece by piece just like I do with a flat iron and it does not get all the frizz out as well as a flat iron. It turns out that I spend more time than my regular straightener trying to get the job done. Sadly, this brush works fine but not as well as my flat iron and not like I have imagined.<br /><br />I admit that this device is not only well made and very sturdy, it is also of high quality and attention to details. I really want to love this product, but I don't think it lives up to the claim that it straightens my hair fully. I will say that it does straighten to certain degree and does a decent job of taming some frizz, but nowhere near in comparison to what I would get from a straightening iron. On top of that, it does not do a good job at straightening my bangs. In fact, it is too large to reach the roots. Every time I stroke my hair to straighten I hit the button and it turns it off. It will take some serious practices to get used to. Regardless, this is a good product for second day straight hair where I just need a touch up or if my hair is already partially straight. I think this straightener would be great for someone who does not have very thick hair like I do. My hair certainly looks less wavy and perhaps slightly less frizzy, but this tool does not straighten hair for the silky effect that I hope it will achieve. Since everyone has different texture of hair, I strongly believe this will work great for those who have thinner, tamer hair or simply using this brush as a touch-up tool.<br /><br />Please see the attached before (left) and after (right) photos<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this hair straightener brush at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",0
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,B00KR4AFJU,4,2016-04-11 22:28:08.000,Best Peeling Kit I've Tried So Far,"This is the 3rd peel foot mask that I have tried. The others have been unsuccessful. Still wanting to experience the foot peel, I tried again. The first thing that makes this foot peel better than the others is the foot slippers. The slippers are actually a medium thickness plastic. They remind me of the “rubber pants” that my little boy wore over his training underwear when he was 2 years old. These slippers also fit the best of the three that I have tried. I had problems with using the tape, but because my feet are on the larger end, they stayed in place well without it. I wear a size 10 W shoe and these fit my feet fine. They were not too tight nor did I have to stretch them to get them on. They were a little confusing to figure out. The directions said to “cut on the dotted line” but I couldn’t see any dotted line. The 2 slippers were attached together at the top. So I cut them apart and then I had to snip a little off the top to open up where my foot was to go inside. This foot peel has a somewhat pleasant scent. I was worried because one of the ingredients is vinegar and another is fermented milk. Those did not sound appealing at all. However, what I smelled was a combination of the ginger and the chamomile. The hardest thing about this whole process was carving out the time to do it. You have to soak your feet for 15-30 minutes before hand. Then you have to wear the foot booties for 70-90 minutes. Then soak for another 15 minutes afterwards. I’m a busy mom, so it’s hard to find that much free time. I've just started noticing some peeling, so already it's looking more successful than the other ones that I've tried.<br /><br />*I purchased these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1

The spots on the side of my mouth are noticeably lighter.  It has a thin texture and absorbs quickly without any sticky residue.  But it's not primarily water.  Nothing against water, but I prefer my serums to have some thickness to them to allow the ingredients time to penetrate my skin.  This one has the feel of a light cream and a soft citrus scent.  Also the ingredients are superior.  It has the sodium hyaluronate version of HA, biotin, squalane and most importantly 3-O Ethyl Abscorbic acid.

I always have ongoing problems of uneven skin tone and under eye dark circles. This special blend of serum is formulated to target signs of aging including dark spots, skin dehydration and dull skin tones. Unfortunately, it is exactly what I need at this point of my life. It may not be fast and effective against deep wrinkles though, but nothing really is other than cosmetic surgeries. The serum is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy or gel-like silicone texture that a lot of serums have. It does have a pleasant light scent which quickly dissipates after applied and the consistency of the serum is somewhat creamy. It spreads very easily and one pump is enough to cover my face so the bottle should last quite awhile. When I apply this serum after cleansing and toning, I immediately feel as if my skin has been infused with moisture. It soaks right in and makes my skin feel more hydrated. It feels smooth and luxurious when I spread it over my face and neck. I have not experienced any irritation or negative reaction to this serum. Nevertheless, it is gentle enough to apply even under my eyes without any burning or itching sensation which has happened with a lot of beauty products I tried over the years.<br /><br />I really adore the elegant packaging, it comes in a beautiful airtight pump style bottle which protects the ingredients and keeps them fresh. It's sanitary and dispenses just the right amount for each application. I instantly love the way it makes my face feel soft and supple on first use and the results over the past week alone have continued to smooth my skin significantly. My face looks and feels more smooth, firm, and has this radiant glow that makes me look so much energetic. It has also helped balance my overall complexion. Even though I have exclusively been using this serum for about a week. I do not expect it to work miracles, but if it can hold moisture to the surface of my skin to give it the appearance of being smoother, then it is doing exactly what I need it to do. I do notice after using it that my skin feels tighter. I have not noticed any change in my fine lines yet, but the texture of my skin is starting to look better already. I am pleased with what I have seen so far and I am fully aware that I should give it at least a month to see results just like with any skincare product on the market. I will continue using this serum to document what my results are over time.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this serum at a discount for my honest opinion.",1

Good price!,"MatrixSight Set (4 in 1) Epilator/Callus Remover is very nice device for women.  I mainly use to remove Callus and it works great.<br /><br />But for review purpose, I used Epilator adaptor and it pulls hair gently and quickly without irritating skin .  It hurts little bit like anything else that pulls hair out of the skin, I wouldn’t lie. But, it’s quick and safe to pull hair.  Unlike waxing, it doesn’t leave skin red or peel the skin.  I can see if someone has lots of hair to pull out, it can be very painful.  I would suggest to put “numbing ointment” about 15 min prior to using Epilator can help ease the pain.  Good thing about using Epilator is, eventually, no hair will grow on your legs.  I have been using Epilator for multiple years and now, my legs doesn’t have any hair. If any, it will be one or two strand of hair and I can even use tweezers to pull it out.<br /><br />Best part of this device is, it’s rechargeable.  I have another one (pretty popular one on the market) and its battery operated and after just couple of use, I need to replace battery.  Just past 3 months period, I think I’ve spend more money on batteries than actual price of devices.

I found several good things about these little beads:<br /><br />-they are lightweight so they won't weigh heavily on your hair and damage it<br />-they are easily opened so that you can slide your hair in and not have to 'thread' it through<br />-they are not large (only 8mm) or overly ornate so they add to your hair design rather than take away from it<br />-they can be used at the root of your hair, the middle of your hair or the end and are still comfortable to sleep on<br />-they come in a pack of 50 which is more than ample for your hair styles (although if you have very thick hair and are using two per braid or dread you may want to get more)<br />-they lock onto your hair or braid snugly<br /><br />The only downside I had with these little cuffs was when I used the first one.  It was my fault though as I closed it too quickly and a bit too hard,  I flattened the poor little thing. Unfortunately once you flatten them they are near impossible to get round again. The next one was simpler.  I had opened it gently, slid my hair through and placed my thumb and forefinger on either side of the opening and GENTLY pushed the ends back together and VOILA! perfectly round still!  With each bead it got easier and easier until I didn't even think about it anymore.  To get them over a rubber band simply slide your braid into the bead then slide it down over the rubber band rather than trying to open and close it enough to fit the rubber band.  Also wrap the rubber band in such that it is the same length and the bead (or a little shorter) so that there is no 'belly' and it is hidden by the bead.<br /><br />Overall I found these little beads to be just what I needed!  I did get my first pack at a discount in exchange for a fair review and that is what I have done.  I LOVE these little beads and am looking forward to getting more for myself and my creations.",1
AEEO4SJ4MMZH2GD3NY56GLGO3VEA,B01COD3ETY,4,2016-04-22 21:39:23.000,Lightweight and compact...,"This makeup mirror is very stylish. It's fairly compact and is very lightweight.  It doesn't have the shiny surface displayed in the picture, but is made of a metallic gray plastic. It would blend well with nearly any decor, and I like the way it looks with my stainless steel bathroom accessories.<br /><br />It has two mirrors; the first is a regular mirror, while the other side is a magnifying mirror. The magnifying effect is a really good one, and there is little to no distortion.<br /><br />It comes with the three AA batteries it requires, which is a plus. It also has an outlet for an AC adapter, which isn't included, but is something most households probably have lying around. It turns on and off by sliding the single switch on the mirror's base. The light it gives off is bright, and illuminates both the mirror and my face.<br /><br /> It seems everyone in my household has adopted this mirror as part of their morning ritual. My husband uses it for shaving, while my daughter and I use it for makeup and skin treatments. It's very nice and would be useful, not only in the bathroom, but on the bedroom dresser, as well.<br /><br />I received this mirror free in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience using this mirror.",1

AEYSQYNVNAW67SK2NEMGCVLYTUZA,B015QOVN2I,5,2016-04-24 17:00:34.000,Love this Eye Cream,"Skederm Ultimate Eye Cream ~ I don't know that I've ever even said this before but I noticed a difference the very first time I used this eye cream! The packaging is very pretty. It's a beautiful blue cannister with a great little airless pump  which dispenses the perfect amount. It's 0.5 ounces but using it only on the eye area should last quite some time.  You only need a very little amount of this cream. It has a very faint scent to it. It's so faint I can hardly smell it at all.  The cream goes on beautifully. I have lived in Florida most of my life  so unfortunately I'm starting to see signs of fine lines above my eyes which I can't believe and they just make me feel older! The first thing people notice are your eyes, right?  They looked terrible and I wanted to take care of this quickly, if possible.  So when I applied the cream,  they immediately faded. Of course I know they're not gone but they're not as noticeable. My eyes also get a little puffy underneath  but the cream  has helped out with that problem as well.  I do have to say that it didn't soak in to my skin as quickly as I had hoped for but after seeing the results I can deal with that. It's not sticky at all! I thought it was at first and realized it was from one one of my vitamin C serums. This morning I scared myself looking in the mirror! My eyes looked I had been rough! So puffy underneath! I did not believe anything would help this mess out. Honestly! I used the cream and once again my eyes bounced back to normal. I mean, they looked so bad I didn't want to leave the house. This is by far my Favorite eye cream ever! I just can't say enough about it!  I've been using it twice a day and will continue to use this to see if there are any  permanent  results. Because of the retinol (vitamin A) I have hopes that there will be!  I received this at a reduced cost for my  honest  and unbiassed review of this product. I really like it and will definitely purchase it  again once it's gone as long as I continue getting good results from it. I do hope my review has helped you in some way.",1

When I first went to use this though, I also couldn't be happier with the exfoliation of it. This is perfect for anyone who is looking for a bit more gentle of a scrub. I've used Lush's Ocean Salt, Franks Coffee Scrub, etc. They've all been much too rough for my face and I've had to settle for body exfoliation. I do use a clarisonic quite frequently so I don't need additional intensive scrubs but I do like A scrub. This has a paste-like consistency and the scrub is similar to something like oats. It helps with any excess dry patches as well as preventing clogged pores. Fig+Yarrow is such an innovated company, I'm not sure why this took me by surprise!",1

Here's what they say about their product:<br />Professional F/X Gelatin Cubes approx. 4 oz *Create realistic wounds, scars and skin effects in minutes! Made with professional fx grade 300 bloom gelatin, these gelatin cubes are widely used in the fx industry for creating realistic quick wounds and prosthetics. Simply warm until melted, apply to skin and paint with makeup. Gelatin can be warmed in a microwave or submerged in a container with hot water. Always test temperature first. Can be re-used and re-melted. Cubes can also be melted and tinted with a small amount of cream makeup, liquid makeup or acrylic paint. Dries glossy. If a glossy look is not what the makeup calls for, it is advised to powder with a neutral (colorless) setting powder and seal with a makeup sealer. Not intended for human consumption. Removes with warm water and soap. Ingredients: Gelatin, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Potassium Sorbate<br />Here's what I say:<br />I LOVE Halloween, I am dying to go on a Zombie walk and I love these gelatin cubes!  I made a bite mark for my son several years ago and wanted to be able to do so without one of the cheap Halloween kits they sell.  I was ecstatic when I saw these gelatin cubes and couldn't wait to get my hands on them.  They were a little smaller than I had thought they were going to be but exactly as described.  I am happy that these did not require any glue and that they could be used directly on the skin.  Heating them up was so easy that I skipped directions and overheated them lol Whoops.  I had to wait a little bit for them to cool down, thankfully I did not destroy them.  I took another cube and placed it in my metal shot glass and put that in a hot bowl of water.  After only a moment or two I was able to stir in the  original gelatin as well with a popsicle stick and begin applying the gelatin to my forehead.  I wanted to make a large 'chunk' of skin and knew it would take a bit of time and patience and wanted to make sure it was just the right size.  I wear glasses because I haven't gotten a new pair of contacts, and I have REALLY bad eyesight so I started it on my forehead, making sure it was the right size and shape.  I put two layers on, just enough to make a proper base then waited about half an hour for it to fully set.  I then carefully removed it from my forehead and placed it on my leg so that I could see it better and have a better angle to 'paint' it with my makeups and other goodies.  I added several more layers using the popsicle stick to apply and shape and smooth out the areas.  I used my fingers as well but sometimes it left little fingerprints.  That was easily fixable though with a little more gelatin or even the rounded end of a make-up brush.  By the time I was done (2 hours later!  I had fun!) It looked like something had torn this piece of flesh from my body. I LOVE these little cubes!<br />I received my first package of these cubes at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review and that is exactly what I have done!  They are easy to work with, loads of fun and definitely worth the investment.",1

I have an old bun maker that I've been using for years, but that one just got tossed in the trash because these new ones are SO much easier to use and the finished product looks much better!! These bun makers are unique in that they are foam, which helps to grip your hair to better hold it in place. They also have a very strong inner wire that holds them in place in a perfect circle. I have relatively long (just past my bust line) hair with long layers - the trick to getting all of the end pieces of the layers to stay tucked in place is to pull the bun maker down the length of your ponytail just before you reach the end of the shortest layer. Then, fold all of the rest of the ends upward over the hair piece and tuck them inward towards the center of the ponytail. As you roll the hair piece upwards, continue to tuck any loose ends in so that they are held in place by the rolled hair. The other trick to getting a perfectly round bun is that once you have rolled the hair piece all the way up with your hair, fold the ends inward towards each other to form a circle, but make sure to tighten this circle as much as possible by pushing the ends as close together as you can. Otherwise, these hair pieces are fairly self-explanatory to use, and there are step-by-step instructions included with each of the four bun maker pieces. In addition to these four pieces, this product also includes 2 sets of 8 bobby pins -- 1 set is about 2&quot; long each and the other set is about 3&quot; long.<br />*I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.",1

It even has the tapioca pearls in the bottom and the spatula looks like a straw. My husband actually asked if it was edible (spoiler: it’s not). Etude House states, “The bubble tea sleeping pack makes skin moisturized and elastic during the night with its compound of black tea gel and moisture capsule bubbles.” After my normal nightly routine, I used the included spatula, I scooped out some gel and two bubbles. You can use less/more bubbles depending on how dry your skin feels. I rubbed my hands together to “pop” the bubbles and mix them into the gel. I rubbed the combined gel into my skin for two minutes using a circular motion. I left it on overnight. Unfortunately, this sleeping pack is pure skintertainment. The results weren’t great. Or even noticeable. My skin didn’t feel or look more moisturized the next morning, but it also didn’t have any redness/new breakouts. So while this sleeping pack is the cutest thing on my vanity, I’m just much happier with the results from the other sleeping packs I’m using.",0

I was so tired of buying  nail files over and over again only to have them break or bend in my purse or just wear out after a month or two. I wanted to invest in something that would last a little bit longer even if it was more than the usual dollar store Emery boards I've become so frustrated with. It seems the cheap files I had been buying were constantly had to replace them.<br /><br />The nail files were shipped to me promptly and they are not only extremely functional, but beautiful. I ordered the rainbow set of 5 and they're soooo pretty.  My favorite is the emerald green one, which is so much more vibrant than it appears in the stock photo and In my crappy phone photo.  I love them. The set comes with a hard case to store them in. And the 5  files in their cases come in a larger zipped pouch!  they are the perfect size to throw in a purse, keep in my desk at work, stow in the console of my car, and store in my makeup bag while still having one extra in my medicine cabinet at home.  When you consider how much I spend on files for my nails and feet on a monthly basis, and I should never have to replace these --- they come with a lifetime guarantee. That is just crazy to me. I will be buying these for gifts for sure. I can’t wait to tell everyone about them.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion/review. If I had paid full price for it, I would still say the same thing. I rely heavily on reviews before I make a purchase so I realize how important they are. Hopefully, you have found this review helpful. Thanks and happy shopping!",1
AGEAJ3SCOEQVBB6CZ2L3VOSZNR6Q,B00VXEQ0WO,5,2016-05-14 01:32:05.000,Another winner from Majestic Pure,"I have many Majestic Pure products (from skin care products, to hair care, to essential oils), and have always been very satisfied. I am also pleased with the retinol cream. Having very sensitive skin, I tend to use products containing retinol quite sparingly (aka, every few days, vs. daily) as they tend to cause my skin to become quite irritated or scaly after a few days of daily use. I’ve been using this around just my eyes every evening (about 1 hour after applying a hyaluronic acid serum), as my skin is so sensitive that using anything with retinol on my entire face seems to really cause a lot of scaliness. And, this is where the fine lines are really beginning to show.<br /><br />The results – after using a cream with retinol in combination with hyaluronic acid serum for 3 weeks, I’ve been noticing a definite reduction in the fine lines. They are still there but they were becoming really noticeable.<br /><br />The cream has ingredients that are highly moisturizing (again, which I like to follow up on a serum with). The consistency is pretty thin (not thick and creamy like a lotion), and there is no noticeable fragrance. It seems to absorb quickly and is not oily.<br /><br />Some note on the ingredients:<br /><br />Retinol 2.5% - Retinol is another name for Vitamin A, which is an antioxidant (helps reverse the damage caused by free radicals, apparent in wrinkles and aging), encourages the production of collagen, and elastin.<br />Jojoba Oil - closely resembles sebum (a waxy substance produced by our skin glands), packed with vitamins and minerals - Vitamin E, B, copper, zinc, selenium, iodine and chromium.<br />Green Tea - Tea is high in anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, whether ingested or applied topically. Green tea contains tannins which can reduce puffiness and inflammation of the skin. It also contains polyphenols, which can combat free radicals (which contribute to aging). The catechins in tea can combat the bacteria that contribute to acne.<br />Propolis - Propolis, “bee glue or bee penicillin” is the resinous material gathered by honeybees from flowers and leaf buds of various plants. It contains dozens of anti-oxidants,<br />Shea Butter - The moisturizers in shea butter are similar to those produced by the skin’s sebaceous glands, making it one of the best choices for super-dry or cracked skin. Shea butter also contains anti-inflammatory compounds – great for applying to inflamed or irritated skin (think eczema, chapped skin, bug bites)<br />Vitamin B5 - A humectant (a water-binding substance that attracts and retains water). Particularly good for the skin as it stabilizes the skin barrier, increasing hydration and improving softness and elasticity.<br />Vitamin E - A powerful antioxidant, that neutralizes the oxidant effect of free radicals, which are molecules that damage collagen and cause skin dryness, fine lines and wrinkles<br /><br />*I received the retinol cream for evaluation and review",1

In fact, I don't get all the positive reviews, this nail polish remover hardly works. It takes a very long time to clean my nails with this. I use a regular nail polish, that any cheap remover, even the one from a dollar store has no problem taking off, but not this natural remover by Pure Body Naturals. I followed instruction, put a drop on each of my nails, waited and tried to rub it off with a cotton ball, to no success. It took some of the polish off, but left a whole lot left behind. It is possible to remove nail polish with this, but totally not worth the time/effort.<br /><br />I also haven't notice my nails feeling any better using this natural product over the regular ones, so I definitely will not be using this one, nor ever buy again, nor recommend. This may be worth, if you don't mind spending long time removing your polish and are very concerned using only natural products, other than that, its not at all. I am very disappointed, its the worth nail polish remover I ever came across, nothing beats it. Unfortunately I already opened it, so I am not going to return it nor gift it, it will probably just go straight into the trash, I don't think I will want to use it any time.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange of my honest opinion.",0

Not with the perfumey scent.<br /><br />Oddly enough it is the perfumey scent that draws me to the soap.  It reminds me of a perfume that I remember having in the late 70's or early 80's. I have been racking my head for a week trying to place the scent.  I just really love that scent!<br /><br />It is a very smooth although small bar of soap.  It feels really good in my hands.  It has a nice latger.  Do not be alarmed by the color that will appear on your skin.  The bamboo charcoal will make it look like you are smearing black dye on your skin.  It is not dye and simply washes away.<br /><br />Overall my skin feels the same as it does with other more natural soaps.  Soft and not dry.  Yet not greasy feeling.<br /><br />I purchased this Phaii Bamboo Activated Charcoal soap in return for providing my honest and unbiased opinion.,1

AEHOFUNZP6VT74RUDDCJ2VVIT56A,B017AGMC3O,5,2016-05-18 15:57:15.000,Argan Oil Is Not Snake Oil,"I've been used this specific shampoo only a couple of times as it was offered by vendor as a 'for review' item but we've been into Argan Oil shampoos for the past half year or so and we are very happy with the results. In fact our teenage daughter insists that whatever shampoo we purchase it contains the Argan Oil.<br /><br />This shampoo provided a thorough, gentle cleaning of my hair and scalp and there is not discomfort or itchy feeling whatsoever after use which is a good thing. Our daughter likes it too but she observed that 'it smells funny'. I do agree that there is a strong, not necessarily unpleasant, smell for a brief few seconds while you are applying the shampoo on hair.<br /><br />Additional facts worth sharing:<br /><br />- It comes in a tube and a tube this size should probably last 2-3 months if used by a couple of people so, while the price is higher than what you'll typically see at a supermarket, it's not THAT high when spread over several months and it's worth the extra few dollars.<br />- While it's not stated anywhere, it seems to act as a conditioner. I would not use use a conditioner after this shampoo myself.<br />- For what is worth, the ingredients include: Aloe leaf extract, Argan oil, Xanthan gum and dozen of ingredients that are difficult to spell or pronounce but the maker promise that there are no petrochemical derivatives or parabens and that no animal testing was conducted.<br /><br />The odds are I will continue to use this shampoo until I am made aware of a superior product. Until then, I am happy with it.<br />____________________________________________________<br /><br />NOTE: If you are curious about Argan oil - apparently very good for both hair and skin - Wikipedia has a very good article.",1

It isn't full of a bunch of chemicals and is similar to a salt scrub. It's not all wet, so don't go wiping it on your face without first getting it wet. The best way to use it, in my opinion, it to take a little pinch/scoop of it and add it to your body scrubber. I think an electric face scrubbing brush is fine it you have shower doors or a shower curtain to keep any pieces from flying all over, but this helps get the scrub really worked into the skin. You can also use it on a body sponge/wash cloth or even with your fingers.<br /><br />It doesn't have a terribly strong smell, it's actually quite mild, which is fine because you don't always need to smell strongly with purfumes and fragrances. Over all it's a good scrub and works well for what it is used for.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

My first impression upon opening the box was, wow this is beautiful. The cream itself, is full of natural ingredients. Rosemary, Black willow bark extract, Jojoba oil, Shea butter, Sweet almond oil, and many more. The cream is white in color and has a very light scent. The scent, I am not fond of. It doesn't stink but it's not great. I can't put a finger on what it is. But it dissipates just as quickly as the cream. This product absorbs quickly as promised. And doesn't leave behind a greasy residue. I do however wish it were in a pump or tube dispenser. Making it convenient for travel and dispensing. Most of us wouldn't toss an orange sized jar into our purses. This cream is 100% natural. Making it ideal for any skin type. And best of all it can be used by both men and woman. With extended regular use, it is said to help repair sun damage/cellular degeneration. And make skin look younger, softer, and healthier. Which we all know, proper moisture is the key to beautiful skin. I recieved this product complimentary for evaluation purposes.",1

If you have hard to manage, dry, brittle hair, this can works WONDERS.  I have very fine, wavy, frizzy hair AND I live in Florida, so the odds are always against my hair.  After realizing that the ingredients in beard oils are the same as the ingredients in many hair products (like tea tree oil, jojoba oil, grape seed oil, etc), and hearing from other women about the benefits of using it in your hair, I wanted to give this a try.  The tea tree oil and peppermint oil are absolutely wonderful for dry, itchy scalps, and just a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  I put a dime-sized amount of the beard oil in my palms and distributed it evenly throughout my hair, from roots to tips, and massaged it into my scalp as well.  This oil is thicker than most oil treatments that are advertised for hair, so again, a little dab goes far!  I like that, though, because it really feels like it's coating and absorbing into my thirsty hair.  As my hair dried, the waves were well-defined and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!<br /><br />Another secret for guys and gals:  this type of beard oil containing tea tree oil can also be used in more uh, private areas.  Why not keep hair in your nether regions just as soft as conditioned as hair in the upper regions?  The tea tree oil is very soothing on razor burn as well.  Basically, this beard oil is very versatile in its uses, and I'm loving it.  Thumbs up, would recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

My acne has basically ceased (other than that time of the month when my hormones go crazy and even then it's still way better than it normally used to be!)

AFOYDZTIH27IJJKIXXKAPVRFQ2OQ,B013L9TX22,4,2016-05-29 00:17:10.000,"Very nourishing, contains royal jelly","I'm 30 years old and have been trying to do a lot of preventative skin care (especially since I live in Florida and get quite a bit of sun on my skin on a regular basis).  One reason I was drawn to this particular neck firming cream was the royal jelly ingredient.  I'm new to learning about the benefits of royal jelly, so for those who haven't hear of it before, royal jelly is a substance secreted by honeybee workers and fed by them to larvae that are being raised as possible queen bees.  When used externally, royal jelly increases the skin's moisture and collagen production, which slows the process of getting wrinkles.  There are tons of other beneficial oils in this cream, all of which can be found on the ingredients list on the product page.<br /><br />This neck firming cream is very thick, but absorbs quickly into the skin, and does not leave an oily residue.  After washing my face and neck area, I put a dime-sized amount of the cream in my palms and then applied it to my neck, distributing it evenly with circular motions.  This cream has a very light and pleasant, almost gingery scent.  The reason I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 si the fact that I did get a few blemishes on my neck after using the cream.  I am not sure if this was a result of an ingredient, or my skin just getting used to a new product.  I have been suing this for 5 days now.  My neck did feel very nourished and moisturized after using this, so I will continue to apply this cream unless more blemishes appear.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

The sun is not forgiving here, so skin care is a top priority to me.  I chose to purchase vitamin C serum from Skederm after reading about their carefully chosen ingredients.  Even the container was carefully thought out to preserve the shelf life of the ingredients.  In addition to many beneficial oils in the serum, the ingredients include hyaluronic acid, which helps retain moisture, which protects the skin from free radical damage, sun damage, and aiding in the reduction of inflammation.<br /><br />I have been using this serum in my daily skin care regimen, applying if after cleansing my face and neck areas.  One pump from the bottle is enough for me to evenly distribute a layer of the serum over all of my face and neck.  The serum itself is actually more of a lotion.  It is white and smooth like a facial moisturizer, and it spreads over skin like one.  The serum absorbs quickly into the skin, and leaves it feeling very hydrated and soft.  I noticed a very slight greasy feeling on the skin under my eyes and under my chin a couple of times after applying, but it hasn't negatively affected my skin in any way.  It may just take longer to absorb in those areas, or maybe I should apply less.<br /><br />Since I started using this serum only 3 days ago, I have noticed less sagging in the skin below my eyes, which has always been a problem area for me.  The skin on my neck also feels more elasticized and very moisturized throughout the day.

My neighbor said I look like I belong in a Hunger Games movie. My realtor said she liked it. It's unusual and eye-catching. It really looks like different shades in different sources of light.

I got it to use as a nail art barrier for stamping and gradients. It works well, and I appreciate the ammonia-free formula. This latex also has less of that fishy smell they latex has; it's there, but very faint.<br /><br />It goes on white, for easy application, and dries clear. It is sticky, but a little cuticle oil or cornstarch helps, if it's a bother. I didn't find it so sticky it was unmanageable, I just exercised a little care.<br /><br />This latex works exactly as I need it to for stamping. It peels off cleanly, in a single piece. It doesn't peel up my stamping, and it makes cleanup minimal. I'm very happy with my purchase, and would recommend it.<br /><br />This latex was a personal purchase, made at the regular price listed at the time. I am not obligated to provide a review, but choose to do so.",1

There are a few things I look to determine the quality of brushes and they’re how well the brushes are put together, how soft the bristles are, and if the bristles are thick and full.  This brush set meets all of my requirements so I’m pretty pleased with this set.<br /><br />This is a set of 32 brushes, with most of the brushes being eye shadow brushes.  These come in a nice roll up case that has a kind of pleather look and feel to it.  When you have the case rolled up it takes up very little room considering there are 32 brushes in it, which is great for traveling.<br /><br />The metal piece that connects the handles to the bristles is called a ferrule.  I’ve gotten some lower quality sets where these are poorly glued together and are loose when they arrive and easily come apart.  These came glued together very well and held up when washed.  The bristles are super soft and they are nice and thick too.  When you pull on the bristles you don’t get a ton of fall out either, so this is another sign of good quality.  You may notice a bit of a smell when you open them but washing them thoroughly will get rid of that smell and it’s not uncommon for brushes to smell like that when brand new.  I really like the variety of brushes and this is a great set at an affordable price.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.",1
AFOYDZTIH27IJJKIXXKAPVRFQ2OQ,B00OS9YWJY,5,2016-06-07 02:13:52.000,Definitely firms and moisturizes. Loving the green tea ingredient!,"I've tried out a few different firming serums lately, in the quest to keep my skin moisturized and looking its best.  I was drawn to Derma-Nu after reading numerous good reviews, as well as wanting to try a serum with green tea in the ingredients.  Most of the other serums I have purchased do not have green tea as a listed ingredient, and I'm really a big fan of all of the benefits of it, so I was sold!<br /><br />The bottle of serum comes with a pamphlet showing other products by Derma-Nu that are suggested as being used in conjunction with this firming serum, as well as a pamphlet showing their line of products for complete body skin care.  Anyway, let's get back to this serum!  I'm a fan of hyaluronic acid and it's ability to hold 1000 times its weight in water.  In this serum, the mixture has been infused with vitamin C, vitamin E, and green tea for their anti-aging properties.  The serum itself is very fluid, and it takes about a nickel sized amount to cover my whole face and neck area.  It spreads evenly and smoothly, and takes a moment to absorb, so it's easy to make sure you've covered all of the important areas (some other serums I've purchased tend to absorb so quickly that I can't get it distributed evenly).  I would recommend using a moisturizer after letting the serum soak in for a few minutes.  My skin feels fantastic after using this, and I've noticed the skin under my eyes feeling firmer just after using this a few times.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

There is no added fragrance and it does not sting or burn at all while using this product. (well...at least I haven't experienced it so far.) It comes with a glass dropper to make using more convenient and to use as little or as much as you like. It is clear in color. I only use a little of this serum on my face and neck, as it takes very little to see improvements. If I use too much, it becomes sticky and less likely to dry as fast as I like it to. My skin is brighter and healthier and has a subtle glow that everyone had commented on lately. I am no longer dealing with an oily t-zone because this has definitely had a drying effect on the oiliness of my skin, thankfully!

Smells like clove though, not citrus.","Ladies and gentlemen, let me appeal to the ladies on the great results that beard oil can have on your hair.  If you have wavy, frizzy, unmanageable hair (as I do), this could really help!  I had been using argan oil and other oil blends to tame my wild hair, and when I read the ingredients in my roommate's beard oil and saw how similar they were, I wanted to give it a try.  I first bought the Tea Tree blend by Beardsmen Spirit, since I'm a big fan of the benefits of tea tree oil, and I liked it so much that I wanted to try out this Rousing Citrus blend.<br /><br />As far as ingredients go, the Rousing Citrus blend has Jojoba seed oil, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, glycerin, grapefruit peel oil, lemon fruit oil, blood orange essential oil, clove flower oil, and vanilla plantifolia fruit essential oil.  I compared this to the ingredients in the Tea Tree blend, which are Jojoba seed oil, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, glycerin, peppermint essential oil, tea tree leaf essential oil, and vanilla plantifolia fruit essential oil.  Not too big of a difference except for the obvious different essential oils.  This oil has about the same thick consistency, and a little bit goes a long way!  It takes about 5-6 drops of the oil to tame the frizz in my hair that's about 4 inches down past my shoulders.<br /><br />One con for me though: this oil does not really have a citrus smell.  I smell clove over everything else, and while this isn't a bad thing, I was really hoping for those lemon and blood orange essential oils to be prominent.  So a more appropriate name for this would be &#34;Rousing Clove&#34;.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.

So after learning that I was so excited to try out this Deluxe Premium Blackhead & Blemish Remover Kit by Mac Professional. This set comes with so many different tools its hard to know where to start. There is one tool in particular that is the coolest, though a bit dangerous. It has two heads that screw into each side for safety and can be removed and screwed on the sides, and has a lancet and another head. Its extremely sharp and you must be careful with it, this is a &#34;professional&#34; set so I really don't use more than the ones just to remove blackheads, very nice set, and I love that it comes with a case that has inserts to safely store every piece.

The seller does a wonderful job of delivering quickly and well packaged. The cologne is very pretty in it's design in a feminine curved bottle with black lace on the front which looks nice on my dresser or vanity.This perfume definitely smells great. It has a sheer musk undertone that is very inviting, you can also smell fruitiness and a slight hint floral and sweet undertones like flowers. It is a very feminine scent but also very seductive but not overpowering. It's difficult to describe scents but all I can say is it really does smell wonderful, it doesn't give me a headache and my fiance loves it. I find that it lasts longer if I spay it on pulse points. I receive complements a lot of times while wearing it I definitely recommend this wonderful perfume and would absolutely say try it. This is a 1.9 ounce bottle at under 13.00 delivered to your door.

No matter if the product is discounted or not, I will leave honest feedback that I base on my own personal experience with the product I receive. *One last note, I wasn't sure what the difference in Eau De Parfum and Perfume is, so I looked it up. Here's what I found on the web on perfume website:<br />Eau de parfum. &#34;After the top notes have died away, the middle notes or heart notes of a perfume become noticeable. This is the focus of eau de parfum which makes it perfect to spray on hair or clothing. (Be careful with delicate fabrics such as silk, though, as they may stain.) The concentration of oils is over 15%, sometimes reaching as high as 20%. Since it is less intense than perfume extract, it is also cheaper, but it usually lasts well and is sold in small sizes.&#34;  So it is stronger than Eau de Cologne which contains about 7% essence dissolved in alcohol of 60º or 70º, and stronger than Eau de toilette which contains around 10% aromatic essence.  But not as strong as Perfume. This is the strongest of scents because of the higher concentration of essences – as much as 40% by volume.",1

It has a really smooth silky texture and is made with natural and organic ingredients. The bottle came wrapped in bubble paper and so did the little dropper that came with it.<br />When I first opened the bottle I noticed the very pleasant smell that this hyaluronic acid serum has. I was really surprised by this because I really expected it have more of a bitter or medicine type smell. It has a very soft smell to it, kind of like roses. After washing my hands, I applied a drop of it to the back of my hand and a little bit of it to my wrist to make sure I was not going to have an allergic reaction to it. I waited 24 hours and until I tried it again. After washing my face, I applied about two drops of it, applied it in a circular motion and that was it. The serum is very smooth and goes on well its non-greasy and dries pretty fast. There was a bit of stickiness but that went away as soon as it dried.<br />After applying the serum and letting it dry, I followed up with my normal face moisturizer. I have been using this product for about a week now and I really like it. I have never used a hyaluronic acid serum before, but this is great I love it. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking to try a hyaluronic acid serum. I also love these products because they are cruelty free and made with organic ingredients.",1

You have to hold the device a certain distance to get it to work properly as if you press down too much, it will not work. The filing pads works pretty good as long as the right amount of pressure is applied with the right amount of distance from the nail. When the right pressure is applied, it works like a charm and I like it better than manual filing because it requires less work. I did my daughters toes and fingers and applying nail polish took the longest time instead of filing which use to take a long time. The kit is handy and travel friendly.<br /><br />CONS:<br />I did deduct some star because you have to work with how much pressure is being applied to the device onto the nail in order for it to work.

AHETDGASODBTH5UNKJMMGGE6M25Q,B01COCJBJC,5,2016-06-20 05:39:03.000,It is a great addition to my makeup vanity,This mirror is a blessing to have.  It is a great addition to my makeup vanity.  I love the way it looks just to sit out for decoration.<br />Mirror is light weight yet the base is heavy.  The mirror does turn over to have normal side then to flip it is magnified.  The best part of this mirror is it is LED illuminated.  It took 3 AA batteries which were supplied.  The toggle switch is on the base and when illuminated it gives that cool glow.  I love plucking my eyebrows with this mirror.  Easy to see and with the added light it works well.  The light is very vibrant and puts off a very nice glow.  Lights are on both sides.<br />I would consider all materials high quality by the apperance and by the weight.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely satisfied with this dual sided mirror.  It has been a great item added to my makeup collection.  Works well to sit on the vanity to give you an additional mirror for up close application and for the magnification.  I am not sure how I have lived my 32 years without a mirror like this to apply my makeup or pluck my eyebrows.<br /><br />I received this mirror for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using this mirror myself.,1

You get 3 cute little tins full of the candies and each had a freshness seal around them. The tin was easy to open, there were no sugar pieces from the coating that fell out, and each tin had 21 pieces in them. I found the size of the coffee drops to be quite adequate, not too small and not too big. I saw where a couple people thought they were huge but they’re about the size of a jelly bean but not as fat. They have a smooth coffee flavor with some sugar added in to make them the perfect little sweet. I found them to be very tasty and enjoyable. One candy at a time is plenty for a treat. They arrived in a cute black box that makes them perfect for gift giving and the tins are the perfect size to put in your purse, pocket, desk drawer, end table or pretty much anywhere else that you want to tuck away some coffee sweetness. We thought these were so good that we’re going to try one of Cavendish & Harvey’s variety packs next.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

I use essential oils so this one looked especially good to me. There are no funky ingredients or chemicals in it, so that was a huge plus for me. Each of the bath bombs has a name and what it is for. My favorite right off the bat was the grapefruit for energy. I was having a tired day and needed a pick me up, so I took a hot bath with one.<br /><br />The bath bomb took a while to dissolve, so it lasted quite a while, then the water turned lightly colored. It was nice to feel on my toes as it dissolved. The smell was lovely, however it didn't last too long. On the next one I used I just dropped a few drops of essential oils that matched the scent, so it helped it stay scented longer.<br /><br />All in all it is a lovely luxury to pamper yourself or give as a gift.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT (IN ORDER TO TRY IT AND REVIEW) THIS DOES NOT GUARANTEE A GOOD REVIEW OR CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE PRODUCT, I AM HONEST AND UNBIASED, ALL OPINIONS ON IT ARE MY OWN AND BASED ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF.

I am one of those people that prefer to do my own nails. I really don’t like to get my cuticles cut at nail shops because not all of them sterilize there instruments and I have had my cuticles bleed from them before. Anyway, this set is great, it is very sharp and this is important so that you get a good even quick cut. I have bought cuticle nippers before and if they are not sharp they just make a mess of your cuticles.<br />This set came very fast in the mail, I got it in like two days and it came wrapped in a plastic bag with its own little carrying case (that’s a plus).  I could tell as soon as I picked them up they were good quality, they are pretty heavy and they are not going to bend or break. The cuticle pusher has duel sides, so you can get under your nails really clean without hurting them, and you can also push the cuticle back with the other end. It works really well.<br />The springs on the cuticle cutter help so that you can move easily around the cuticle area of your nails smoothly. I also noticed how easy these are to clean off I just rinsed them off in warm water, and then dried them with a towel. It says these are rust proof so we shall see.<br />I would recommend this set to everyone that does their own nails. I received this cuticle nipper and pusher set at a discounted price for my honest, unbiased, opinion. I take all of my reviews serious and am very honest about them. With that being said I love this cuticle nipper and pusher set.",1

Because I have been using products to work on wrinkles and younger looking skin regularly for the past few years, it's difficult to see new results. This eye cream is a nice creamy consistency. I don't notice any smell from it at all. I am able to apply this to the eye area of both of my eyes with just one dispense from the pump. It absorbs nicely into my skin and keeps my delicate eye skin well hydrated. One thing that I especially like is that it doesn't sting my eyes! I have ultra sensitive eyes and if I sweat, make up and skin care products will often get rubbed into my eyes. Some products cause them to sting or burn. We're having a hot summer here in Georgia and even with sweating, I have not had any issues with it stinging or burning. I've had to stop using some of my favorite beauty products in the past for that problem.

Oz./ 100 ml - Inspired By The One Cologne]]<br /><br />I was looking for new scents or signature scents for my future husband and wanted to try this. I like and appreciate the scent of The One Colognes so this was one I wanted my fiance (Bobby) try this scent. Buying signature scents can become quite expensive to say the least and this is a way for us to get an idea of what a scent smells like with Bobby's chemistry without spending thirty five or forty dollars and then not like it. Besides if this cologne scent stays on and lasts a while we may opt to purchase the less expensive cologne. The seller delivered very quickly and we received packaged well. Since this cologne is an Eau De Toilette Spray, it will have slightly more of the oils (10%) that make the spray smell great than just cologne which has about 7% oil. The scent also is delivered in a convenient spray which me and Bobby both like. The cologne actually smells very nice on him. It's a sort of woodsy, citrus masculine scent and you can definitely smell oranges and ginger in it. The One Cologne describes the scent as &#34;Coriander, Grapefruit, Cardamom seed, Tobacco, Basil, Cedar, Ambre, Ginger, Orange Blossom.&#34; Some of those things I have no idea what they smell like, but I'd say this not really a musk based scent but it smells really yummy on Bobby. It takes a little more spray than the original version The One Cologne, however, it's about 1/3 the cost, so I won't complain. It's still pretty strong with a couple of sprays being all he needs. As far as wear, it lasts a long time. It's sensual/manly in it's scent and he said he received several complements on the cologne. It is also a large bottle at 3.3 ounces delivered to the door for under 15.00. We like the cologne and can recommend it.",1

It was hard to unscrew, but with a napkin around the ball and a pair of pliers I was able to get it to come undone. There is zero irritation from wearing this, and I ordered this with two other KeyZone products, which were packaged together completely together and in great condition. The anchor is a safe size that won't hook onto any clothing. It is very well made, with the rope texture and gems along the top and bottom of the anchor, with slight pointed edges of the hooked part with no irritation of them. Definitely worth the buy!!

A bit intense when first sprayed on, but very mellow shortly afterwards. It reminds me of a lot of scents that say &#34;refreshing&#34; or &#34;water.&#34; I absolutely love the smell. Its not even super manly either and could almost be worn by a woman without much notice. I definitely love this smell on my fiance and I think it is my most favorite of all the polo inspired scents by Watermark Beauty. Of course like most of the other ones my biggest issue is that they not not last all day long. They start puttering out about halfway through the day and will need to be re-applied, and also like most others it comes in a large 3.0 Fl. Oz./ 90 ml bottle, so it should last a while even with a second application every day.

It's touted as being good for beginners, but I was really nervous about using it for the first time, because it came with absolutely no instructions. Yikes! I'd cut my nails down to nubbins, and have been wearing falsies, so I figured it was a great way to get some practice.<br /><br />There are a few notes on the product listing about how to insert and remove the drill bits, so with that being all I had to go on, I just went for it.<br /><br />As I had no clue as to which bits were for what job, I had to wing it. I tried two. The first I tried wasn't quite coarse enough, so I went with the larger, barrel-shaped bit, which worked well for what I wanted. I'd basically put on some stiletto tips, and managed to jab every family member at least once. I didn't want to completely remove them, but I wanted to take them down a bit and round out the tips. Once I changed the bit this drill did a great job.<br /><br />It got a little warm, but didn't get too hot, and it didn't overheat and stop on me. In my photo is what they looked like right after I was done. I did go over the edges briefly with an emery board for the couple of rough spots left, simply because I'm not yet quite adept enough to get the perfect shaping I want, but practice is key.<br /><br />It's for the same reason that I haven't yet tried the drill on my natural nails. I will, though, once I get a little more know-how under my belt. So, in summary, I like it, and it seems to be beginner-friendly, but I wish there were detailed information available on its use.<br /><br />I received this nail drill free to try in exchange for my evaluation and unbiased review.

I also add some body wash to the scrub in order for me to make my job of ''scrubbing'' easier. Then I use cellulite cream. Then, I apply a homemade wrap with grocery bags on top. Then, heating pad on the low settings, then, my waist trimmer on top. Have it for an hour. While that time I study or sleep. I also drink detoxifying tea during the procedure.

I want to look good for as long as I can and because of that I've often used Vitamin C serums. I know they are effective and help with aging skin a lot,  My skin has always been a challenge. I have oily skin with large pores and sometimes have uneven and dull skin. I also have some expression lines on my forehead. I wanted to start using this serum as soon as I got it home. The serum comes in a very nice bottle which I like a lot because not only is it pretty but the serum is delivered in an airless pump which distributes exactly the right amount of serum to my fingertips for easy application to my face. Since Vitamin C products are easily oxidized I appreciate the product being dispensed this way so that it protects the serum and keeps it effective. I have been using this serum the morning on cleansed skin after toner, and then again at night before moisturizer on clean skin in the same way. The serum has a nice scent that is not overpowering and it only takes a pump or two of the serum to cover my entire face. The serum doesn't feel greasy or oily and it's just the right consistency to spread easily. There was no burning or irritation with this product, and it absorbs well into my skin with no left over residue. My skin feels smooth, silky and refreshed after I apply this serum as if my face has a refreshing blast of moisture. It looks supple and moisturized for hours and I've noticed my makeup stays on better. I have been using the serum for about two weeks now. Since then I have noticed a lot of amount of improvement in the tone and smoothness of my skin. It doesn't look as dull  and my skin also looks firmer. My skin is more radiant and soft and the expression lines in my forehead appear a little softer and the improved clarity of my skin is noticeable. My skin also looks better when I'm not wearing makeup. My skin has improved a little and I've been asked what had I been doing to make my skin look better? That makes me feel more confident that the serum is working. I am going to continue to use this serum and consider it a good value worth every penny of the asking price here since a little goes a long way.",1

These are some fancy smancy ones.  I was quite shocked to see the packaging for these when they arrived I was not expecting this.<br />These have a beautiful well crafted box that these come in and inside of the box you ill find your 6 bath bombs wrapped individually and set in some small crinkle packaging.<br />When getting a packaged set of anything I usually always have one that I really do not prefer but this set of bombs they all smell heavenly.  Love the aroma these put out while in the tub and love how the aroma lingers in my bedroom for a while afterwards.<br />Love how these just relax you while sitting in the tub after a long hard day.<br />I am in love with this set and would purchase again.<br />I received these bath bombs for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to the conclusion by using these bath bombs myself.,1
AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA,B01DEDYWD0,5,2016-07-07 22:38:38.000,Radiant Skin,"If you are looking for something to make your skin look super healthy, toned and vibrant this is a good option if you are used to using serums. I have been using this for two weeks now and found the best way to apply it is to add a drop or two to my regular face cream, then apply. Otherwise you get a sort of yellow tanned look that takes a bit to rub in and disappear. I found using it along with the face cream was the fastest and easiest way to apply it.<br /><br />The oil is sort of yellow like a turmeric oil and contains rosehip, neroli, chamomile, rose, frankincense, lavender, and bisalolol essential oils. So you can see how healing this also is. I don't notice any scent from the oil it seems relatively mild. I think this bottle is going to last me a long time since I use so little of it. The results are great (including smaller pores!) and I'm happy I tried this product. It is a time saver since I don't have to blend my own oils.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review<br /><br />I received one free bottle for review purposes.",1

You do not need to do too much to it beside dip wash it when received, as you should ANY wig prior to using. Everyone loved this wig on my head and honestly I hate big hair but this was sexy. I got the D03 color/length. I am just a wig wearing beginning so I have been trying many wigs for fun and just new looks since I only wear my hair straight.<br /><br />My comment will not say verified purchase because I buy rushed products through a family member account since they have a prime membership.",1

I'm a rock collector and I am all about beauty so this definitely peaked my interest!<br /><br />I've been using this for about a week and honestly I haven't seen an improvement in my complexion or anything fancy but this is awesome to use before applying makeup. It seems to grab the makeup and hold it on longer. Weird I know it isn't the intended use but it works! I also use it after I've done my make up to set it. If you compare ingredients to most setting spray that is all natural they are almost identical.<br /><br />The smell is light and flowery. Definitely has a scent of Rose with a bit of a witch hazel after scent.<br /><br />The spray itself is medium mist and covers the entire face with one burst. It's very light and absorbs quickly.<br /><br />This is a nice hydrating mist that has a multitude of uses and I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this item at a discount.

AESCAQQYIK3SYLMLRXPRNPKXIC4A,B013RJY9A2,5,2016-07-12 15:03:45.000,Great product and great results,"Searching for a safe and effective skin brightener is always my top priority because I have a never ending battle with skin discoloration and dark sunspots. I love the fact that this serum is gentle and does not contain the harsh chemicals that most skin lighteners do because I prefer using products that have natural and botanical ingredients as much as possible. This product comes in a dark amber dropper bottle which protects the product from sunlight exposure. It also contains Glycolic and Kojic Acids as the key ingredients which I believe will lead to clear and brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. It is not greasy and does not form a film. I have somewhat sensitive skin which is pone to irritation and redness, but this serum is very gentle without causing any breakouts or negative side effects. I believe it has been gradually improving my dull looking appearance by making the spots a bit lighter.<br /><br />I use the product as directed after cleansing, toning my face and allowing some time to dry before topping with my regular moisturizer. This light weight clear serum not only applies smoothly and evenly, but it also has a fresh light scent that will dissipate after it dries. It has a liquid gel like texture which leaves my skin soft and smooth, not to mention it is also fast absorbing without any uncomfortable feeling and leaves my face quite moisturized. I have even started using it to lighten the sun spots on my hands and the results are impressive. Although I have not been using it for long, my skin tone has started to look more even and I have also noticed that some of my blemishes have cleared up along the way. My darker spots still exist, but they look much better and I can see some significant improvements of my lighter ones.<br /><br />I am sure everyone's skin is different, but I have experienced zero sensitivity or dryness. I love how much clearer my skin looks throughout the day and my skin feels more balanced. My overall appearance is much brighter and smoother. The brown spots on my hands are slowly fading in under two weeks and I can say that I am really happy about it. In fact, everybody's skin type is different and the effects may not be the same or visible for everyone. I have used it twice a day for quite some time now and the brightening effect seems to be progressing. There is no miraculous or overnight whitening as such, but with gradual fading of sun spots, my face does appear clearer and even toned. This product does what it promises and lightens my dark spots. This is a great and reasonably priced dark spot corrector serum that I will definitely buy again and I feel quite confident to explore other products from the same line to further improve my skin conditions.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this dark spot corrector at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",1

I got the make-up brush set in two or three days; that’s always a plus. It came in a very cute black tube (this is a keepsake tube). Inside of the tube were the brushes and a blending sponge (another plus).<br />When I took the brushes out I instantly fell in love these brushes are super soft and elegant looking. I can tell they are made out of quality materials, and if taken care of properly you will have these for a very long time. When I used the brushes for the first time, I could tell that the bristles were not going to come and stick all over my face like other brushes I have bought in the pass.<br />In this set you get, a blush brush, foundation brush, eye shadow brush, blending brush, lip brush, and an angled liner brush. You also get the blending sponge. I am very happy with my purchase and I am going to purchase another set of these for my mother, she will love these. These brushes also make a great gift especially because of the cast they come in.<br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased, opinion.

If you have cellulite, you have to try this cream!","I try my best to stay as fit as I possibly can, but there are those problem areas that seem to haunt you no matter what you do. For me, that area is the back of my upper thighs. While this area is not bad, there are small areas where the cellulite is noticeable. As soon as this cream arrived I started using it twice a day, once in the morning and then again before bedtime. The instructions also ask that you apply the cream in a circular motion. This was a bit more difficult since I was rubbing the back of my own thighs, but I eventually got into a rhythm and was able to get a circular motion going on. Since this item arrived in the afternoon, I was only able to apply this cream once the first day. Did not notice too much of a difference the following morning, but I was not going to give up that fast. Applied it again after my shower and went about my day. That evening when I went to look at my thighs, for some reason one of them looked better than the other one. Much smoother and tighter!! I thought maybe I had  spent more time on that thigh than I did with the other one, so this time I focused more on the thigh that looked the worst. Woke up the following morning and both of my thighs looked amazing!!! The skin looked tighter and there were fewer dimples. I have been applying this cream every day as instructed and I cannot even tell that I had cellulite just the week before. This stuff is AMAZING!!<br /><br />This product contains an intelligent dual active formula. This formula contains Adiposlim 3%, a cellulite fat burning compound that drastically minimizes fat in different parts of the body. It actually shrinks fat cells below the skin to help rid the skin of that spongy layer of fat that usually forms over muscles. Adiposlim 3% also collects fat cells which are burned off for energy during physical activity and restricts the combination of free fatty acids that collect in adipocytes to dramatically minimize parts of the body with fat deposits. Adipoless 1% helps in preventing new fat from forming. This fat-fighting compound works by maintaining fat loss results, and it avoids the growth of new adipocytes and the combination that keeps fat cells in their dormant state so they remain in their shrunken state. Adipoless 1% also provides anti-adipogenesis action restricting the formation and maturation of new fat cells that can lead to fat deposits over time. That may sound like a bunch of jibberish to some, but to sum it up, it means this cream will not only get rid of the cellulite, but it will also keep it from coming back! It does not get better than that. I love this cream! Best I have ever tried, and I have tried many!<br /><br />My experience with other cellulite remover creams have been decent, but this cream works miracles! Now I want to work on other parts of my body, although I may not have enough cellulite to see any results. I am very pleased with this cream! Will continue to use it until I am not able to get anything else out of the bottle!! Then I can order more!! Buyers note: I did receive this cellulite remover cream at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but that has no bearing on my review. This is the real deal of cellulite creams. Please vote if this review was helpful in any way. Thanks in advance!",1

Most of the serums I have been using are vitamin C or hyaluronic acid serums. This is one of the few times I have used a serum focused on niacinamide (vitamin B3).<br /><br />This serum comes in a dropper bottle for easy application. Droppers also help you ensure that you don't waste any product and remain hygienic. The serum applied very easily to my skin. I use a few drops of serum and massage it into my face every morning. I have been noticing that my fine lines are diminishing quickly! I have some fine lines around my eyes, forehead, and mouth. But this serum is diminishing their appearance! This serum is also great for those with age spots, as it will fade them over time as well. I have noticed that when using this serum nightly, my skin does feel firmer and smoother. This serum has been doing well with my sensitive skin and has not broken me out!<br /><br />This Premium Nature serum also contains neem oil, avocado oil, and vitamin E. These ingredients are known to be soothing and anti aging. The ingredients are always high quality. I would recommend this serum to those of all ages.

I enjoy this product immensely because it leaves me skin moisturized without the heavy residue most intense moisturizers do. After two straight weeks of using this moisturizer, I have concluded that it works every bit as well, or better than the name brands I have been paying more money for at the department store. This moisturizer leaves my skin comfortable, soft, and matte all day long. The scent is delightful in my opinion and I find myself terribly addicted to the wonderful aroma. Even though it feels light on the skin, it helps my makeup glide on smoothly with absolute moisture. It feels like it disappears as soon as it is rubbed in, and yet it keeps my skin perfectly balanced and moisturized all day without the shiny greasy looking. I especially need something to help my sensitive skin stay hydrated and soft. This moisturizer seems to have just the right formula for that purpose without causing any breakouts.<br /><br />This facial moisturizer is rich and creamy. I really appreciate that this product is not greasy or sticky. When using this moisturizer, I can actually feel it sink into my skin pretty fast. It instantly makes my face feel very smooth and it soaks in rather quickly without leaving any uncomfortable residues. I have been using this cream twice a day and always making sure to cover my eyelids as well. It is so gentle for my sensitive skin that my skin does not itch or turn red. It is not greasy, but the coverage is thick enough to sufficiently provide moisture for night time. I do not like oily or sticky moisturizers, but I do prefer certain degree of a good moisturizing coverage. This is a very good face cream compared to many other brands of moisturizers that I have used not to mention the fact that it is made by skin healthy ingredients and botanical extracts.<br /><br />I have only been using it for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin is starting to feel smoother and firmer. However, there has not been much difference in my fine lines yet, but I strongly believe it will further benefit my skin with consistent use. The tone of my skin also seems to be improving and I could not be more happier. This is a good facial moisturizer that I find perfect for my skin type during the day since it has helped my makeup look natural and smoother. I will definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good face cream to provide adequate moisture and combat signs of aging.<br /><br />Disclosure: I purchased this facial moisturizer at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",1

This cleanser does not foam, however, you can feel it cleaning. It has a pleasant scent and is amazing at removing makeup. I have found a little bit will do it, you don't have to use a lot of cleanser to clean your face.<br /><br />I haven't seen any miracle results but I will tell you it does clean well.<br /><br />Overall a decent cleanser.

It is fairly easy to learn how to do, it's incredibly fun and really can amp up the look of your nails. The downside of all that is it can get expensive!! This 11 piece set from Tinksky is a great value for all that you get, and is perfect for anyone that either wants to try it out -or- wants to build up a variety of images. Granted, there aren't any examples shown of the stamping plates that you'll get, so that's a little bit of a mystery. If you don't mind that, I do recommend this set!!<br />Attached are photos of the plates that I received... I am super happy to have the images that I received and although I don't love the stamper, it is nice to have!! Keep in mind that you may have to experiment with your technique and try different polishes with these plates. Just because you may not get an image to pickup on the first or second try does not mean that the plate is trash. Not all stamper heads and polishes will work together nicely from plate to plate. Having said all that, I have had pretty good experiences using these and I am a beginner.<br />I was given a promotional discount on my purchase in exchange for my review.<br />Would I buy it again at full price?

I like one that has good ingredients, and a great smell. When I saw the label for this saying Argan Oil, Coconut Oil and Tea Tree Oil, I knew it would be right up my alley. I love all 3 of those ingredients and they work well with my skin. I was excited to use this. When it arrived and I checked the ingredients label, I was shocked. Like so many other reviews, I don't see any of the above listed on the label. Some ingredients are very vague. Some of the ingredients I had never heard of before and had to look up. My suggestion to the company is to make the label a bit more descriptive and clearly put what is inside. What essences? What type of vegetable oils? Since it is so unclear, if you have easily irritated or sensitive skin I would stay away from this. The vague label makes it hard to use by anyone who may have allergies to certain things.<br /><br />On the other hand, I will say that I do like the body wash. It smells fantastic, like a herbal scent. It lathers nicely and feels good on the skin. Doesn't dry my skin out.<br /><br />If the label was changed and I knew exactly what was in this I would easily bump this up to a 5 star rating. But because I have no clue what is inside this, I have to bump it down.<br /><br />*Please note that I was sent this product either complimentary or discounted in order to provide my honest experience, thoughts and review.",1

The one issue I had with this is that I thought that it would be shaped so that it sits right on the head, like others I have seen before.  However, it is not - it has loops in the end for pinning although pins do not stay in my hair very well.  I tried to tie ribbons to the ends but that did not work.  I ended up having to purchase some elastic in order for it to stay well on my head and not feel like it was going to fall off.  I am happy with the tiara though, since the workmanship looks good, it is durable feeling, and it is pretty.<br /><br />I received this item free in exchange for wearing it and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.

I've only heard negative things about the original stamping polishes from BM so I don't own any, I've only used MdU. But when BM reformulated their stamping polishes I gave them a try and I now own all the new collections so I gave these a try too. Boy am I glad I did. These DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I don't own white stamping polish, I use Sinful Colors Snow Me White that has been open for 3 days, it works but it's still not proper stamping polish.

AEKVBGFD6LE3Q63LGW5HLMQ7LUJA,B017IIV4XI,5,2016-08-01 17:17:03.000,light and awesome,"why use a primer... well below are some reasons why you must:)<br /><br />I loved this one because you need very little to make your face looks all smooth and fresh.<br /><br />read what else I found:<br />If you haven’t been using makeup primer, then you’re really missing out.<br /><br />Whether you wear a full face of makeup everyday or you prefer to keep it simple with BB cream and tinted lip balm, makeup primer is a godsend when trying to combat shine or create a smooth base for foundation.<br /><br />Yet, many people often skip this step because they believe they don’t really need it, are unsure of how to use it or don’t think it’s worth the investment. However, using primer underneath your makeup will make everything last longer, whether that’s on your skin or in your cosmetics bag. We asked two beauty experts to discuss the ins and outs of primer and why it’s a must-have. Here’s the deal.<br /><br />Makeup primer is a base for foundation or face makeup that allows it to go on smoother and last longer.<br /><br />Formulas are available in cream, gel and powder. While moisturizer softens skin, editorial and celebrity makeup artist Stephen Dimmick points out that primer prepares skin for your favorite tinted moisturizer or foundation, giving it something to hold onto so it lasts throughout the day.<br /><br />Many makeup primers are formulated with silicone-based polymers like dimethicone because of their ultra-smoothing effects. But for those who struggle with cystic acne and other skin conditions, do a patch test or check with a medical professional before use, as there have been reports of allergic reactions to dimethicone.<br /><br />Physicians Formula’s celebrity makeup artist Joanna Schlip adds that makeup primers can also help smooth any fine lines, wrinkles or large pores. If you are searching for a face primer to help color-correct rosacea or conceal acne spots, Schlip’s go-to is this light green primer as that hue cancels out redness.<br /><br />Primers are even available just for your eyelids to prevent creasing. “I’d recommend pairing a primer with extra long-wear [eyeshadow or eyeliner] formulas for a look that will really stay put,” says Schlip. If you have oilier eylids, Dimmick advises that you use a mattifying eyelid primer.<br /><br />Using your fingertips to apply makeup primer allows you to really work the product into your skin.<br /><br />Schlip thinks it’s best to apply primer with fingertips for areas larger than a quarter. “If only using for small areas, I’d recommend a brush. I like to use a concealer or lip brush for this,” she said. This spot-treat technique gives the look of a more natural finish, according to Schlip.<br /><br />Taking this routine a step further, Dimmick considers the process “an exercise for the face.” He explains that massaging primer onto skin with fingertips helps “to get the blood flowing underneath.” We’ll consider that the next time we’re meditating while putting on makeup.<br /><br />Primer is a life-saver for getting your makeup to stay-put in extreme weather.<br /><br />If you live, visit or plan on traveling anywhere that experiences hot and humid or cold and dry temperatures, Schlip suggests having primer handy to help your makeup wear longer. However, Dimmick advocates for using primer year-round. “No matter what the weather is like outside, this extra step will save you a lot of time and effort.”<br /><br />Primer can even be worn on its own.<br />Love the fresh no-makeup look but want to look a bit more polished than when you first woke up? Primer is your answer. The product can be worn on your eyelids and double as a light eyeshadow, or it can serve as a lighter alternative to foundation.",1

I usually slick back my hair, and on especially hot days, it can come undone, leading to a rather homely look. Now the only thing I have to do is take the comb out of my pocket and I’m good to go! Although my beard isn’t anywhere near as long as I’d like it, It also works well there.<br /><br />The comb itself features a nice sandalwood scent that is both refreshing and calming. The wood on the comb feels very sturdy, and the teeth on the comb feel as if they will not break easily, like plastic combs do.

Hyaluronic works because :<br />I have a new skincare obsession: hyaluronic acid. I’ve been using hyaluronic acid for about a month and I’m amazed at what it’s done for my acne-prone skin. Inspired to learn more about how the stuff works (and if it’s really ok to put something involving the word “acid” on your face), I talked to a few experts to find out what hyaluronic acid is and why, exactly, it’s so awesome.<br /><br />I first read about this magical stuff called hyaluronic acid over on I Heart Daily (tons of good stuff over there, all the time, by the way!). Then I found it recommended over and over again as an ingredient in facial creams in the beauty magazines I read on a recent flight. So I thought, why not try it? I ordered up a bottle and started using it, twice a day.<br /><br />And whoa. When I layer this on underneath my regular daily moisturizer with SPF, my skin looks incredibly dewy. Yup, dewy. I’d always read that word in beauty mags but thought it was just an overused editorial cliché, not a descriptor that could ever be applied to my own skin, with its large pores and tendency towards oiliness. But dewy it was. And the acne that’s plagued me since 7th grade (over half of my life) has considerably lessened, too. All of a sudden, I have beautiful, clear, perfectly moisturized skin, even in the dead of winter.<br /><br />I’m pretty committed to being as “natural” as possible with my skincare, meaning I try to buy products that use ingredients sourced from nature rather than chemicals and plasticizers. I knew I loved hyaluronic acid, but I wanted to know more about what it actually was and if it fell into my own admittedly loose category of “natural.” (Yes, I know I probably should have done more research before I started slathering it all over my face.) Here’s what I found out:<br />What Is Hyaluronic Acid?<br /><br />Hyaluronic acid isn’t necessarily a new ingredient in skincare, but it’s been growing in popularity in recent years. According to Dr. Jessica Krant, dermatologist, founder of Art of Dermatology and Assistant Clinical Professor of Dermatology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center:<br /><br />Hyaluronic acid, or hyaluronan, is the body’s lubricant molecule. It is basically a very big and complex sugar-related molecule called a glycosaminoglycan that is found naturally throughout the body and works in many different ways to keep us healthy and active. It’s involved in the health and function of skin, joints, and the immune system, among others. It is very popular as used in a number of cosmetic fillers known as hyaluronic acid dermal fillers, which get injected under the surface of the skin to replace lost volume and fill deep folds. Lately, topical products have begun to include the molecule as a moisturizing or antiaging ingredient.<br /><br />So, it’s found naturally in the body and is commonly used in fillers. Ok. But if it’s found in the body, where, exactly, does the hyaluronic acid that I use on my face come from? Cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Oscar Hevia explained that cosmetic hyaluronic acid is made in a lab:<br /><br />The current method of production involves bacterial fermentation, a process whereby genetically modified bacteria can produce the hyaluronic acid in large quantities which is then filtered extensively to obtain a purified, finished product.<br /><br />Is Hyaluronic Acid Natural?<br /><br />So is something that’s made in a lab “natural?” Dr. Hevia continued:<br /><br />…it depends how you define “natural.” Most would probably not utilize this term for a substance that is produced by genetically modified bacteria, but nonetheless, the finished product is pure and identical to human hyaluronic acid.",1

It will help make your skin look so much better and smoother.<br />read this article to make an informed decision:<br />What Is Skin Bleaching?<br /><br />Skin bleaching is a cosmetic treatment to reduce the prominence of skin discolorations and even out the color of the skin. You can buy bleaching creams over the counter and by prescription.<br /><br />Some people apply skin lightener to their entire body to change their complexion, but this can be very risky. The active ingredient in some skin lighteners is mercury, so bleaching can lead to mercury poisoning.<br /><br />Mercury is a toxic agent that can cause serious psychiatric, neurological, and kidney problems. Pregnant women who use a skin lightener with mercury can pass the mercury to their unborn child.<br /><br />The use of mercury as an ingredient in skin lighteners is banned in the U.S. However, some skin lighteners produced outside the U.S. may still contain mercury.<br />How Do Skin Lighteners Work?<br /><br />Skin lighteners contain an active ingredient or a combination of ingredients that reduces the amount of melanin in the skin where it is applied.<br /><br />How Do Skin Lighteners Work? continued...<br /><br />The most widely used ingredient in skin lighteners sold in the U.S. is hydroquinone.<br /><br />The FDA regulates the use of hydroquinone in the U.S. Over-the-counter skin lighteners can contain up to 2% hydroquinone. Dermatologists can write prescriptions for lighteners that contain 4%-6% hydroquinone.<br /><br />It's important to check with your doctor before using a product with hydroquinone and to follow the doctor's directions exactly.<br /><br />Other skin lighteners use drugs such as steroids and retinoic acid, which comes from vitamin A, as active ingredients. And some skin lighteners use natural ingredients such as kojic acid -- a compound that comes from a fungus -- and arbutin, a compound found in various plants.<br />Risks of Skin Lighteners<br /><br />One of the most significant risks of using some skin lighteners is the potential exposure to mercury. One study found that nearly 1 out of every 4 skin lighteners made in Asia and sold outside the U.S. contained mercury.<br /><br />There are other potential risks of skin lighteners. Those risks can include the following:<br /><br />Prolonged use can contribute to premature aging of skin.<br />Long-term use may increase the risk of skin cancer from sun exposure. Always use sunscreen when using a skin lightener and going out in the sun.<br />Steroids in some skin lighteners may increase risk for skin infections, skin thinning, acne, and poor wound healing.<br />Applying steroids to large areas of skin may put you at risk for health problems related to steroid being absorbed by the body.<br />Hydroquinone may cause unwanted and untreatable skin discoloration (ochronosis).<br />Various bleaching agents, including natural ingredients, can cause skin irritation or allergic reaction.",1

The lavender essential oil really stands out in the scent, and makes this cream's aroma super relaxing.  The cream is pretty thin and liquidy, so be careful when pumping it out.  A little bit goes a long way.  One pump covers one of my hips.  I am using this cream to diminish the appearance of the stretch marks on my hips and scar that are on my shoulder.  So far, the stretch marks seem to be blending in with the rest of my skin a bit better.  I haven't seen much change on the scars, but they are very large, so they may just take more time.  I have been applying this cream twice a day on clean, dry skin.<br />The cream does leave a bit of an oily residue after applying it, but if you massage it into your skin enough, this all soaks in after a few minutes.  There are many essential oils in this scar cream, which I'm very happy about, since I've been reading such positive things about each of their benefits on skin.<br />I'm happy with the results I'm getting with my stretch marks, and I'm going to continue using this on my scars as well.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

AHYUFOFTGNEV4TGMQLASS6EA7QAQ,B01GJF555O,5,2016-08-18 00:50:45.000,It actually works!  This is pretty amazing on my curly hair!,"I am always sceptical when I see advertisements on TV for products that seem 'AMAAAAZZZZING!  MUST BUY NOW!!'<br />I wasn't too sure what to expect with this. I thought it was gimmicky, but I am happy to be proven wrong.<br />This is so much easier to use than a flat iron.<br />I like that it has a digital LCD that shows you what temperature the brush is heating up to.  It gives the heat range that your hair styling should be at depending on thickness, etc. I set mine to 230, the hottest setting and it worked great for my thick, curly hair.<br />It heats up very quickly and the hand grip is comfortable. The cord rotates from the end and the grip on the back of the wand feels nice in the hand.<br />The rubbery nubs on the ends of the bristles offer some flexibility, but they are not as flexible as your hairbrush. They are also shorter, too.<br />The way that you do this is to start with clean, well brushed hair.  As the bristles are short, they will not detangle for you.  Have your hair prepped and ready.  If you use a smoothing serum, it would be perfect to add it before you start with this.<br />You simply brush it over your hair like you would a hairbrush. You can brush from underneath or on top to make sure that all the hair gets close to the heated plate of the brush.<br />You can spend more time on areas that you want straightened more but I found that my doing my hair in pieces (held up with an alligator clip) worked best for me.<br />In order to get to the roots at the scalp, it was very easy.  The brush is easy to angle towards the scalp and it gets about 1/2&#34; away from the scalp easily and starts straightening from there.<br />If you hair is damp, you will see some steam, but you'd expect that with a curling iron or flatiron, too.<br />This actually worked so well, my kids wanted to try it out and they loved it!<br />The only concern that I had was that if you hair is the type to come out when you brush it, it will come out when you use this, too.  The issue was removing the hair from the straightener.  It is HOT. I had to work quickly to sweep the excess hair from the brush to toss.  I will keep a wide tooth comb by this the next time I use it so I can run it over the bristles and remove the hair.<br />All in all: I give this a strong thumbs up!<br />I can't speak about the others on the market, but this one really does what it says it will do.  It is way better than a flat iron.  It covers more ground and feels more comfortable in the hand.  Its a natural movement to brush your hair and this is no different.<br />Excellent new beauty tool!  Very happy that this does what it claims to do!  Part of my daily hair regime now!<br />If you found this review helpful, please click the 'yes' button below.<br /> I have personally used the product and tried my best to reflect my experience with the product so you can make a more informed purchasing decision.

AEFPUG75M773VCAG2R6DG3HBDWOA,B01AKTK50U,5,2016-08-19 14:49:25.000,Reduced Puffiness!!,"I bought this Best Under Eye Cream for Wrinkles, Dark Circles and Puffiness with Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, MSM, Glycolic Acid, Green Tea, Rosehip Oil and Coenzyme Q10 for the puffiness under my eyes. I don't have very dark circles but I do have them a little bit. I haven't noticed any change in the appearance of those dark spots but I have noticed that my puffiness and fine lines have been responding well to this cream. I can feel my eyes tightening up as the cream dries. I have noticed my skin feels more hydrated and looks and feels more firm! It's very easy to use and doesn't have a bad smell!! All I do is getting a very small amount on the tip of my middle finger then very gently tap it into the skin all around that area until it's absorbed. It takes a good few minutes but I try to be very gentle so I don't make that area look worse!! I use it in the morning as part of my moisturizing routine and then at night in my bedtime routine. This is a very great product! I do have one purple blood vein that runs down from my right eye that has recently popped up and this cream seems to be helping to make that less visible to me!! I love that!! Luckily, I found this product in time to hopefully keep that at bay! I am very happy with this product and will definitely continue to use it to see what other benefits I notice!!",1

It is a generous eight ounces, comes in a clear plastic bottle so you can tell when the product is getting low, and it comes with a handy flip-top lid that can be manipulated with one hand for ease of use. The scent of this is very light, if there is any at all. The label is tidy and contains the pertinent information, such as ingredients, Made in the USA, product information, and directions. The “Best by” date is clearly marked on the bottom of the bottle and is about a year out, giving me plenty of time to use the Micellar Cleansing Water.<br /><br />Life is busy and there is always a lot to do, which is the perfect reason that I love this Micellar Cleansing Water. It’s great to use any time you want to wash your face, but my favorite use for it is when I come in from gardening or I have been busy working away at cleaning the house or whatever job I have been doing that may get me feeling a little grungy. I just put a dab of this on a cotton round and wash my face well with it, helping to make sure all that dirt isn’t left on my face too long and it works perfectly and is wonderfully refreshing. I love how easy this is to use, how quick it is to use, how well it works, and that it contains absolutely no harmful ingredients. I have not tried Micellar Cleansing Water before this. I’m very happy with this and am thankful I stumbled across it. I love it!",1

AEKVBGFD6LE3Q63LGW5HLMQ7LUJA,B01FYWWWE0,5,2016-08-25 20:36:10.000,Too good,"It is often claimed that periorbital dark circles are caused by tiredness or working too hard or even just staying up late. While this can be true, the truth is that your genes play a huge role here. So what exactly is happening when you get dark circles under or around your eyes?<br /><br />Simply put, periorbital dark circles are a result of the thin layer of skin below your eyes showing the blood vessels and the blood they contain more clearly than anywhere else on your body. (For reference, this skin around your eyelids, called periorbital skin, is on average about 0.5 mm thick compared to an average of about 2 mm thick on most of the rest of your body.)<br /><br />Now, as you may or may not already know, the reason veins often look blue isn’t because the blood inside them is blue; it’s because your skin/subcutaneous tissue only lets blue/violet wavelengths of light pass through it. As a result, only blue light is reflected back and the veins look, well, bluish. (Veins often won’t appear blue if a person has darker or lighter skin. Rather, the veins tend to appear green or brown. On the other hand, people with extremely light skin, such as albinos, will typically have veins that show up as dark purple or dark red, more closely resembling the actual color of the blood running through the veins.)<br /><br />It’s the exact same concept with the skin below your eyes. Those dark bluish circles are (usually) just the result of light being reflected back off of the blood vessels sitting just below the surface of that incredibly thin patch of skin. This is the same reason facial bruises are more prominent below or around the eyes; the thin skin just shows the blood from the ruptured blood vessels a little bit more clearly.<br /><br />Again, as you may or may not know, as we age, our skin loses its elasticity and ability to regenerate and as a result, it becomes thinner. This is why more often than not, elderly people will have rather prominent periorbital dark circles regardless of how much they sleep. As with those who are genetically predisposed to having thinner skin below the eyes, it’s just biology.",1

I found the consistency to be light and silky and almost undetectable on my skin after it absorbed. My skin just felt hydrated and bouncier. For my dry skin, I usually like more emollient creams for night time use. I found this cream perfect for daytime worn under an SPF cream and foundation or a BB cream. I use it in place of a serum and it acts like a makeup primer, blurring lines and pores and making skin appear smoother while adding a dose of hydration. Not a lot is needed. I use four small dots to cover my entire face. From what I can tell it is also color and fragrance free.<br /><br />The key ingredient that attracted me to this product is the Ceramide Complex consisting of Ceramides I, III, VI and natural ingredients (palm oil, algae extract, and fig extracts) that act to hydrate and firm skin. The Skederm ExHydro Ceramide Complex Moisturizer also has glycerin and silicone derivatives in it to increase water retention and give your skin a silky feel. I love that it is supplied in a tube. It's not fancy, but it is very convenient and hygienic. This Skederm product is made in Korea which has been at the forefront of cosmetics and skincare research in recent years.",1

Nothing else compares.","Several years ago I had purchased a blowdryer with a similar attachment. I absolutely adored that thing - you could use it on the top of your hair or the sides to give lift so your hair had volume without using any product or doing any backbrushing. The thing was a miracle worker!<br /><br />Then we entered the era of pin straight hair, and volume and body were out. Thank God, we seem to be passing that era, but hairstyling implements seem to be lagging behind. I was dying to try this diffuser to see if it emulated the gizmo from long ago, and it does. Well made hair styling tool that gives lift and volume to your hair, I love it. Well, kinda.<br /><br />I'm not sure how 'universal' this is. I tried it on my current blowdryer, and it didn't fit. I had to go digging around until I finally found a Conair dryer upon which it fit, and the funny thing is that it fit like it was MADE for the dryer. The odd thing is that the Conair looks to have the same kind of nozzle the other blowdryer had, so go figger.<br /><br />IF you have a blowdryer that marries this diffuser well, this is definitely something you're going to want in your hair arsenal. It'd almost be worth getting a new dryer just to use this, it's that good (one star off for the weirdess of the 'universal' claim.)",1

This rivals the high-end one I purchased from Lancome a few months ago. The product came boxed with the ingredients listed. You're also getting a sealed refill cushion compact included in the box which is amazing for the price. The compact is made of a high quality white plastic. It's easy to open using a push button in the front. There's a good size mirror in the upper lid and a hinged plastic cover to prevent the cushion from drying out. You can hear a soft click when it's closed, so you know it's not going to open inadvertently. There's a Myconos branded applicator that rests on top of the cover.<br /><br />The foundation I got (#2) works well with my NC20-25 skin. It's not a heavy foundation. I would consider it moderate coverage at best. It's very blendable and like most cushion compacts, feels very light on the skin. I included a picture which shows a heavy application on my cheek blended out towards the front of my face. Wear is very good. I haven't felt the need to reapply after using it in the morning. Like a lot of Korean cosmetics, the quality and cutting edge technology used is amazing. This is a fantastic deal especially since a refill was included.",1

The citrus scent, while good, is more of a clove scent than a citrus in my opinion (as the product DOES contain clove), but it is not at all overpowering in any way, so it will not clash with your colognes or other fragrances that you wear. Just a small drop is enough to keep your facial hair looking hydrated, as there is truly nothing worse looking than a dry beard! This blend of beard oil contains many top quality oils such as: grape seed oil, orange oil, jojoba oil, and more! The 4 oz. bottle will last you a very long time. In fact, I have barely made a dent in mine! If you’re growing out your facial hair and want it to look its best, this beard oil is a great place to start!<br /><br />I was provided this beard oil for free in order to evaluate and provide my honest feedback through a review.",1

It has all the great qualities that fractionated coconut oil has and it is truly a multi-purpose oil.  A few days ago, my face got some allergic reactions to something, everything I used and ate was normal but somehow my face got redness all over, bumpy, and it stinks when I applied my normal face product, even Argan oil.  Didn't know what to do so I called up my facial lady and she said use coconut oil.  So fortunate to have this bottle of fractionated coconut oil handy so I began applying it on my face.  I was skeptical at first, didn't know how my skin gonna react.  I have to say, it worked wonder.  First, it didn't stink my skin, so I figured it was a good sign.  I thought it was going to be greasy but it actually was not greasy at all.  And it absorbs very quickly too, I only used like half a pump the first time, and then I reapply about 15 minutes later.  I have continued applying both days and nights up until today and my skin had calmed down and it feels great.  Very moisturizing, I have to say, I like it better than argan oil.  Argan oil is more rich compared to fractionated coconut oil so maybe it doesnt' work as well on sensitive or inflamed skin.<br /><br />If you google fractionated coconut oil, there's a looooong list of ways you can use it for.  Many Do It Yourself projects, make up remover, skin moisturizer, massage oil, crayon remover, hair conditioner, helps to fade stretch marks, shaving lotion, etc, etc, etc...<br /><br />I would totally recommend this bottle of fractionated coconut oil by Sky Organics, 5 stars product!<br /><br />Ingredients<br />100% PURE MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE OIL (FRACTIONATED COCONUT OIL ,COCOS NUCIFERA) COLD-PRESSED BY EXPELLER METHOD.",1

It also tends to be dryer than it use to be. This shampoo lathers really well and tames the frizzies and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It's also not as dry as it had been prior to using. I can't tell you exactly what is smells like. I don't love it but it dosnt really bother me either and it dissipates after washing. You really only need a small amount to get a good lather going. Since it's a rather small, 8 ounce sized bottle I won't be sharing it with the family either.  This one is just for me. I love a good shampoo and this fits in that catagory for me.

Very specific and she didn’t want anything that did not have at least those two ingredients.<br /><br />The reason is a conversation with her dermatologist. Matrixxyl is made of 2 peptides, palmitoyl-tripeptide and palmitoyl-oligopeptide, which stimulate collagen and elastin production in the skin. And peptides form a long chain of amino acids to become proteins, penetrating the top layer of skin cells and signaling the cells including collagen.<br /><br />The Cazbe serum works really nicely in tandem with my mom’s Ponds cream (she has used Ponds as long as I remember). The serum absorbs pretty rapidly and unlike other serums, doesn’t seem to leave her skin feeling sort of ‘tight’ or dry. After a few minutes (she will put the serum on before brushing her teeth, and then follow with moisturizer after teeth), she will apply the Ponds cream to completely moisturize her face. I’ve tried this a few times and find I can only really use it around my eyes – it dries out my cheeks and chin. If used just around my eyes, it feels a lot better.<br /><br />Her skin is looking beautiful. I think in combination with a really solid cream to sort of ‘seal in’ the benefits, after washing your face, and just before bed, it’s a great part of your beauty routine.<br /><br />* we received the serum for evaluation and review",1

I think I use it in 90% of my blends, whether in the diffuser or in topical blends (or sprays, etc). The only thing I definitely don’t use it for is my home-made cleaning products where citrus oils are the only essential oils.<br /><br />This particular oil is a very delicate scent – some lavender oils can pack quite a punch in terms of the scent. This is certainly floral and has a ‘high note’ to it. You can easily pick it out of a blend. It’s my first oil from New York Biology and I’m very pleased.<br /><br />I love blending lavender in particular with chamomile, as it has an almost instantaneous calming effect. Also love to blend it with bergamot, ylang ylang, mandarin, and a drop of lime.<br /><br />The bottle is very large, a dark brown color to protect the oil from UV rays which can damage the oils and decrease the shelf life. My favorite way to dispense oils is with the eye dropper (the euro droppers found in smaller bottles tend to gush several drops at once, so that’s definitely not my preference) – you can really control how many drops you dispense with these eye droppers.<br /><br />Arrived well protected in bubble wrap and there was no leaks.<br /><br />* I received the oil for evaluation and review",1

My mom and I like to make organic foundations as part of our products for sale at craft booths. These containers were too small to use for selling our product but they work very well as samples so we can let people try before they buy! It came with a bunch of labels that fit perfectly on the lids so we printed our contact info on them and hand them out when we're just walking around trying to drum up business! They are small but very handy! As far as the amount I really do not know the exact measurements but it is basically big enough to hold enough foundation for about 5-7 applications. The jar itself is about the size of a quarter and about half an inch tall. I am so happy we found these!! They are such a great marketing tool! And they are really excellent quality, I was so worried about the lids coming off but every single one has stayed tight! I will absolutely buy more of these, I really feel like they helped up to gain new customers and they looked really nice!",1

AEFIRU4QN3NCWT7D74KL4G4AVQLQ,B01I2MU2JQ,5,2016-10-02 14:21:47.000,Great fractionated coconut oil,"I ordered this bottle of Fractionated Coconut Oil by Sky Organics 16oz- 100% Pure MCT Oil (Cocos Nucifera) with PUMP. Ideal as a Massage Oil & Aromatherapy. Carrier Oil Made in USA because I always keep coconut oil in my supplies for all of my diy skin care projects. This fractionated coconut oil came quickly and undamaged. It was wrapped in a plastic bag and had both a flip top pour top and a pump.  This fractionated coconut oil is light and non-greasy and perfect for many of my diy projects. There is no odor so it doesn't interfere with your essential oils. This 16oz bottle will go a long way and since it is fractionated it will have a longer shelf life so don't worry if you don't use it all at once. Keeping this bottle in a cool, dry and shaded/dark place to help extend it even further by preventing light damage.<br />Fractionated Coconut Oil is an all-natural carrier oil that readily absorbs into the skin, making it an ideal oil for topical delivery. provides a soothing barrier without clogging pores and is excellent for dry skin and hair. It leaves skin feeling silky smooth and non-greasy,Use it to fade stretch marks, to help repair the skin, on cracked lips, discolouration patches, and even to remove makeup. If you have dry, damaged hair, it’s also worth trying coconut oil.The capric and caprylic acids work as antioxidants and disinfectants, and the low molecular weight of the oil means it can easily penetrate the hair shaft. Apply the coconut oil directly on to the hair and leave for 15 to 30 minutes. (do not leave it on overnight or throughout the day because it will start smelling nasty as the day progresses) Coconut oil can be used as a great natural shaving lotion. It creates a wonderfully smooth surface for razors, while nourishing and soothing the skin. Put a few drops in the palm of your hand and apply to the skin before shaving. Fractionated coconut oil has antibacterial properties and can be mixed with anti-bacterial essential oils such as cinnamon leaf, cedar atlas, ravensara, eucalyptus, bergamot, geranium, tea tree, thyme to create a natural treatment for wounds.",1

I only recently started doing this again, so I do have some experience with different oils.<br />That being said, I used this coconut oil last night, along with some of my other items, and made a small amount of a foot cream that I like. I always do a small batch when using a new brand/product. I don't want to waste anything.<br />First of all this oil blended nicely with the other ingredients.  After it cooled overnight, I checked to see how well it set. I check to make sure that there is no separation and that the blending still holds. It is still the way it should be. I then rubbed it into my feet, and put on my shoes and socks. I have had it on for about 4 hours now. I took off my shoes and socks and checked my feet. They are much softer then this morning.<br />This means that this is a good product, and does just what it should.<br />I am disabled and I always leave a review on products I purchase/receive. Whether good or bad, I am always honest. It makes me feel like I am productive again.

It has a very slight but engaging smell which is earthy, enticing, and invigorating. I became intrigued after reading about the many benefits of Moringa oil so I decided it might be worth trying. I ordered from Inn & Co because their Moringa oil is 100 % organic. Also because I am always on the look out for value and good prices, and this Moringa oil comes in a good sized bottle about 4 inches tall which holds 4 fluid ounces of oil. That is a good size as a lot of oils come in much smaller bottles and cost just as much. So Moringa oil is filled with antioxidants and phytonutrients along with supposedly reducing wrinkles and sagging fatigued skin. It also boasts anti inflammatory benefits. So here I am to report that the oil, along with being a delight to smell, is refreshing, relaxing, and hydrating to my face and hands. No, my wrinkles have not wondrously disappeared but I can report that my dry skin on my face is being diminished. As for my hands a little bit of the Moringa oil rubbed in both of my hands leaves them feeling so luxuriously hydrated I just want to hold hands with everybody! I'm really enjoying this oil. I think it's a great asset to my unending quest in preserving what small amount of beauty I have left. Plus it makes me feel good and it sure does pamper my skin. I'm enjoying making it a staple of my health and beauty routine.",1

It came with a push-top dispenser in place, under which there was a rubber stopper to keep the oil from leaking on its journey to me. Also in the bag was a pump dispenser, should I prefer that. It’s nice to have the choice of dispensing and the pump dispenser is my choice. It makes it so easy to fill up a little roller bottle or squeeze bottle for my concoctions AND easy to dispense when I use it as an after-shower moisturizer. The label contains all of the pertinent information, such as company contact information, product information, directions and possible uses, ingredients (100% pure medium chain triglyceride oil aka fractionated coconut oil (cocos nucifera), cold-pressed by expelier method), seals earned. I like that this is 100% pure and natural and is odorless and colorless, making it a perfect carrier oil for aromatherapy blends. This Fractionated Coconut Oil is chemical- and additive-free, non-greasy, and eco-friendly.<br /><br />I use this Coconut Oil most of all in my roller ball bottle blends that I make for others and for myself more than any other use, but I also use it as an after-bath moisturizer, either by itself or mixed with my choice of essential oils. I pat it all over while my skin is still slightly damp, allowing it to sink in and keep the moisture in. I like that it is completely scent-free, so any essential oils I may add to my blends doesn’t need to try to overpower the carrier oil. This is a lovely big bottle and I love the pump dispenser for use one-handed and for ease in filling bottles to just the right height. This oil also has, on its own before even adding essential oils, antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties. It makes a lovely massage oil and can blend with other oils for a more rounded benefit. I use this almost every day, which makes this generous 16-ounce size perfect for me. Sky Organics is one of my favorite brands and I will definitely be purchasing this again, although this bottle should last me quite some time.",1

Both masks have the same ingredients, just different packaging. This mask is not only a go-to for me, but it's one of those masks that consistently helps with my breakouts.<br /><br />A Fast Intro to One of my Favorite Masks:<br />🐌 Mask is black and one piece.<br />🐌 The scent is amazing, clean and reminds me a little of baby powder, but not overwhelming.<br />🐌 Mask was really easy to unfold and apply. It comes out of the package dripping with essence.<br />🐌 The packaging is plain, but looks clean and is easy to open.<br />🐌 I generally apply this mask and leave it on for 30-45 minutes.<br />🐌 Ingredients include charcoal, spearmint extract, and arginine. All address acne, clogged and enlarged pores.<br />🐌 I have a huge forehead and this mask afters great coverage. My only complaint is with the bottom half of the mask. The fit on my chin area is a little off. There's not enough mask to tuck the mask under (and have it stick) to my chin/neck, but too much mask to leave just dangling off my chin. A few snips with a pair of scissors and the fit is perfect.<br />🐌 Anytime I start to breakout, I reach for this mask. My skin always looks so much calmer after and it boosts the hydration in my skin just a bit without making my face oily. The next morning, my skin looks healthier, acne/clogged pores look less aggravated and a lot less noticeable.",1
AFHVOR6BHMCYEBKXIEUD4YEFHIVQ,B0016P7GEQ,1,2016-10-13 15:02:17.000,Huge itchy bumps develop into huge itchy pimples,"There's something in this mask that causes my forehead (mostly but not exclusively my forehead) to break out in large red itchy bumps.  I've tested it six or seven times to make sure it couldn't be something else coincidentally causing those bumps and it's definitely this product.  I use it in the morning and by that afternoon the bumps/itchiness have started.<br /><br />I use quite a few different mud masks without issue.  I have another brand of manuka honey mask...no problems.  There's either something in this particular mud that disagrees with me or else the combination of the two ingredients seriously aggravates my skin.<br /><br />The mask goes on well and feels OK while it's on the face but I've never noticed any good reaction to say that its effectiveness is impressive.  It's a mud mask.  Unfortunately for me, it's a mud mask that isn't destined to be used.",0

I can see my scar already getting lighter and I can also see a slight change in my the darkness on my knees. This lotion also smells really good.

It comes in a small container so I was kind of bummed at first, but what little product is in here packs a powerful punch.  I highly recommend this if you're looking for a clay or mud type of mask to clarify and clear your skin. I suffer from deep cystic acne and broke out earlier this week. I put on this mud mask and I could not believe how great the results were. Within one day my pimples had disappeared and even my damage spots seem to be less noticeable.  My skin felt super soft and clear.<br /><br /> I have a pretty sensitive skin but I didn't have any irritation from this whatsoever. The package says to leave the mask on for 10 or 15 to 20 minutes but I noticed that even after 20 minutes, the mask still was not dried so I did leave it on for longer.  It is a bit of a drying mask so if you already have dry skin, you will want to use a moisturizer following the mask.  I found that when I combined it with my acne medication that contains benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid, it was just to drying for my skin. Therefore, I would recommend maybe skipping a day of other chemical products when you use this mask.<br /><br /> The mask it goes on really nice and smooth. I used a Q-tip to mix up the mask material as the directions say to stir it each time you're going to use it.  Then I just used the Q-tip to apply the mask and I from layer on my face.  The mask has a cooling a fact and isn't a dry or itchy at all. It was a very pleasant experience overall. It wasn't messy at all to use either.<br /><br /> I posted some pictures below of the material in the jar as well as when it was on my face.  That way, you can see how quickly I put the mask on my face.  I hope the photos are helpful.<br /><br /> Again, I recognize that this is a smaller container than I had previously thought, but you don't need much to cover your entire face. Although I can't say for sure, I am guessing that I would get at least 10 to 15 masks with this product. That is quite a bit considering how much is charged for mud mask facials at spas.  Do you make sure that you see all the container tightly and store it in a cool or dark place as it will dry out quickly if you leave it open.",1

It's packed with powerful ingridents and I'm sure it help but we all know when it comes to skin care we have to be patient. Packaging is good and it comes in air tight jar dispenser which is good but my problem is when pushed, too much cream comes out, in fact it is enough for whole face. So instead of opening and putting back the cream in the jar I just use it all over my face. When applied I feel my skin tightening that means it is working at least on the wrinkles but I have to wait and see the results on my dark circles. Overall it is a good moisturizer, my skin feel hydrated and supple and I find wrinkles under my eyes have softened. I recommend this product as a moisturizer rather than just eye cream.",1

The Rousing Citrus isn't what you might expect. It is not that bright refreshing Citrus smell that you might be anticipating. It is more of a clove with citrus in the background. When you put it in your hands and onto your beard you smell the Citrus right away. But just as soon as you put it on your beard and rub it in the Citrus dissipate and there is a rather strong close scent. If you like the smell of clothes like I do then you will love it. If you don't then you will not like this sense at all. To be honest I had to use it about 3 or 4 times to really decide if I like it or not. So if you buy it and you used it for the first time and don't like it try it for another 3 or 4 days and see if you still don't like it.

I purchased mine in November of 2016, and nearly 6 months later I still regard it as the best money I've ever spent on skincare, PERIOD. I used it on my full face just last night! It gets a regular workout too, between myself, my mother and my daughter. Even my son has used it! I just had to come update my review when I saw that deceitful grade but in a way I'm thankful because I know now that Fakespot can't be trusted. I KNOW THIS DEVICE WORKS AND WORKS FANTASTICALLY!<br /><br />I'm fortunate to have had a great example when I was a child. My mother always took very good care of her skin. Until I reached my teen years I literally believed that all women used peel off masks, apricot scrub, Noxema and Oil of Olay, lol. Skin care has come a long way, and when I started working in the beauty industry I was introduced to higher quality products and left my mother's favorites in the dust, haha. As far as exfoliating, before trying this machine I'd always stuck with scrubs, chemical exfoliants and microdermabrasion crystal creams. Now I feel like a need a good kick in the rear for not investing in real microdermabrasion years ago! I absolutely love this machine ... it is an investment, but the effectiveness and sheer convenience of it make it more than worth the money. You just can't get results like this with any other method. My favorite thing about it is the suction. Sure, you can use products to manually exfoliate skin, but vacuuming the oil and dead cells that collect inside and clog pores combined with abrasion literally and immediately take years off the skin's appearance. It also allows the high dollar serums and moisturizers we apply to do a much better job. Again, to me this totally justifies the investment. If you're serious about skin care and spend good money on expensive products, you owe it to yourself to prep your skin so your products can do their jobs!<br /><br />Pros of the Bright Therapy unit:<br /><br />Rechargeable<br />Strong, adjustable suction<br />Different attachments for heavy, light and acute abrasion.<br />Comfortable to hold, fit's easily in the hand<br />Has disposable filters allowing you to see exactly what the machine removes every time you use it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great quality microdermabrasion system I think you'll be pleased with this one, I can't find a single con to owning it. I absolutely love mine!",1
AE5ICIRUSWJAI2K3HS23K63JD2PA,B01DL9K0LK,3,2016-11-12 02:42:35.000,I wouldn't lie to you!,When I first received the brushes they didn't have an order of any kind but I always soak my brushes in warm water and a little shampoo since I like natural hair brushes. I had very much shedding on my big brushes! The shedding lasted for a while and then stopped but they worked perfect after the shedding stopped not sure if some hairs on the brushes weren't placed properly or not. The brushes arrived in a good time so I gave it three stars!,0

AEGNRZI3ROAWTBOC4SAJKF2A2CAA,B01IIUP1XE,5,2016-11-15 01:05:28.000,Leaves hair shiny & with body.,I have been using the Hair lab conditioner for about three and a half weeks now and I am very pleased with the product. I was wondering what effect it would have on my hair as I color my hair regularly and thought it might fade out my hair. But it has not faded my hair color at all and it feels wonderful as I apply this conditioner to my hair. The conditioner leaves my hair shiny and with a lot of body. I love the way my hair looks and feels with this product. As for hair loss I do not have excessive hair loss but I do often notice strands of hair in my comb or brush and I'm glad to have this product as it helps my hair to be very easy to comb gently so I don't have to yank tangles and fight with trying to comb my hair which does lead to strands of hair coming out. I like this conditioner alot and in my opinion it is a fine product but it is not a miracle product for anyone who has severe hair loss. It is a great conditioner and support for your hair.,1

I am thankful for the extra care taken so that I can feel better about safety.<br /><br />Since I have been using this, my eyelashes are soft and well-conditioned and do not break off as much. I am not sure whether they are growing or not, but they are definitely in better condition (so it makes sense they are growing longer) and I will continue using this and can recommend it, especially if you do have a problem with lashes breaking off or falling out.

Usually I know immediately if the product is a hit or miss, but Vitabrid C12 is different. I can’t decide. I’m torn. After using VC12 for about 3 weeks, I am still unsure of the results.<br /><br />The concept: Vitamin C is slow released thru the skin by mixing a small amount of VC12, with water or a moisturizer, onto the face and neck. The results, brighter, smoother and firmer skin. The powder comes in a convenient small bottle (about the length of your thumb) with a small spoon (used for measuring). Simply mix the appropriate amount - I use about 2 spoonfuls since I put it on my face and neck- with a lightweight moisturizer. I didn’t notice any tightness, irritation or itching after I applied this to my skin (i.e., face and neck). I simply apply my makeup as usual. With that being said, I haven’t noticed anything bad either -no additional breakouts and no nasty white film (left on my face from bad blending). But I also haven’t looked in the mirror and said “wow” or “gosh, this is like a facelift in a bottle moment”.  Not to mention that this product takes a little more effort than my usual skincare regime. I am not use to mixing products before I use them. **Therefore, I am going to give this product 3 stars BUT continue to use it for a little longer to see if I am wowed. After all each container is believed to last about 3 months. If I notice something earth shattering in the next month or so, I will amend my review. Otherwise, this review will stand.",0

AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B01MTQW0BK,3,2017-01-10 16:23:36.000,Nice look; feels pretty solid; but average in performance & value,"This is a “dressed up” version of the Wahl “LifeProof” shaver (which I also reviewed). It has a more upscale look and feel to it, plus adds a battery gauge to show the charge level. However, the shave quality is the same – OK, but not a standout.<br /><br />The case feels more solid than the LifeProof and, while it’s more of a traditional look, I think they did a nice job with the overall aesthetics. It is pretty grippy even with wet hands. It does not, however, feel as comfortable to hold as the more sculpted models such as most of the Panasonic shavers and some Braun shavers.<br /><br />The shave quality of this model is identical to that of the LifeProof: very Remington in how it feels (close, but rather aggressive). Performance is best on the easy spots (cheek) but not as good on the more trickier spots (neck and jawline). The flex head helps with dealing with face contours but it lacks enough travel to do an excellent quality job.<br /><br />The aggressiveness of the shave is dialed down when using it wet. It needs a very, very thin layer of shave cream (the gel style creams work well) or the head gets bogged down.<br /><br />Love the trimmer! The positioning could be improved to make it easier to use, but it cuts very cleanly on sideburns and ‘shash trimming.<br /><br />The controls are clean, easy to read and tell you all you need to know (charge and battery status).<br /><br />I like the feel of this better than the Wahl LifeProof, but the shave quality keeps this at the same rating (average, which is 3 stars). It’s a very workable shaver, but for the price there are better choices available from Panasonic (anything in their Arc line) or, for less money, from Remington.",0

I think of Wahl as a hair clipper and probably wouldn't have thought of them when replacing his razor, but I am glad to have learned that they make just as good of a quality razor. He uses a regular razor in the shower, then runs an electric around to catch any missed spots. Because of this the battery doesn't need to be charged very often. The battery life indicator is very helpful as is the razor's ability to charge very quickly. He likes it. He is not raving about it being the best razor ever, but we are both happy with this unit.",1

Half of the powders come with significantly less in the pots than others, not cool. The silver powder works the best in terms of mirror effect, the rest are more holographic. The colors are not nearly as bright or defined as those pictured, many of the colors are very similar. They're okay, but I wouldn't spend this much again. I'm going to try out some of the cheaper powders from. The biggest reason I bought this was because it was prime and I didn't want to wait a month.",0

The scents of the Sandalwood and Ylang oil are not very strong. The shower gel because of the oil will not lather very good but my skin felt good after using it. Didn't get dry or itchy. The bath salts were very nicely scented and was great in the bath. I would have just purchased the bath salts as the shower gel is the only complaint in this kit. Was expecting a better lather and more of a scent but overall it was a nice gift and came packaged in a nice wooden double door box that the kids want to paint now. Wife and kids happy.,1

On the second or third application to my 14yr old son's face it did remove blackheads. Not all of them, but as I pulled it off I could see a blackhead sticking out of the side of his nose. It was a vomiting experience for me as I think that's nasty, but none the less it was obvious that a blackhead was coming out. He still has them around his nose and we work a couple days a week at removing them. This stuff may be good for not so rooted in blackheads, not sure. But again it's no miracle cure. After 4 uses he still has blackheads, but the area around his nose looks clean and oil free, so maybe this will stop the development of new blackheads.",1

You dab a bit of the white powder into your hand and mix it with your regular moisturizer, which you then apply to your face. I used a little water and my usual Aveeno moisturizer with SPF 15 sunblock.  My face does look a little brighter after using it for a week but the effect is somewhat similar to using a light-colored makeup foundation.  Unfortunately it has little effect on my crow's-feet or my small &quot;laugh lines&quot;. It's OK but since I can get the same effect applying certain types of makeup or concealers, it's chief benefit is that it's good to use when you don't want to wear makeup and want something that has a lighter feel on your face.

The 360 degree swivel cord is convenient &amp; makes it easy to move the dryer around without the cord getting twisted.

After stopping on some of the powder. I used this liquid in the inner corner of my eyes,  cupid's  bow,  around my eyebrows, and just the finest bit at the very peek of my cheekbones.  The end result was so eye catching and naturally beautiful that I couldn't believe it<br />... I felt like a whole new woman.

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,B01CK8ORXU,5,2017-03-13 21:07:53.000,Absolutely the BEST for nail art and I've tried MANY!,"Good liquid latex is every nail artist's best friend. I decided to purchase this jar after using up my supply of prepared/bottled liquid latex varieties, and I am so glad I did. Prior to discovering Liquid Latex Fashions, I was buying liquid latex marketed as &#34;nail art tape&#34;. In terms of package price and the consistent quality of product, I find that this is the much better option. As long as I continue to stamp, water marble and do gradient nails I will continue to use THIS. Here are the highlights as to why I think Liquid Latex Fashions is superior to all the rest:<br /><br />* Package size is 4 ounces and an ample supply for simple nail art. It is smaller in real life than what it appears in the ad photos. I have been using this as my go-to for the past six months and have barely made a dent in it. I suspect that it will probably dry up before I can get through it all.<br />* Product is simple to decant - the large mouth on the jar makes it easy to use an infant medicine syringe to draw the liquid up and dispense into a clean nail polish bottle. (You can get the plastic medi syringes for free at the pharmacy counter - all you have to do is ask.)<br />* Consistency is thin/watery, which is easy to apply and dries very fast. It turns to a dark pink when it's dry. One layer works great for me, but you can add more layers if needed.<br />* It peels so good! Always a clean peel in one solid sheet - no bits and pieces of latex that break off. You can literally roll your fingertip across the edge and peel it off in one whole piece. No more fighting with latex removal after doing a gorgeous gradient!<br />* FYI: Ammonia free does not mean odorless. This product does not smell good at all. If you've used any type of liquid latex before, you know it does have a distinguishable smell. It is somewhere between fish oil and cat urine. Or a mixture of both. Yeah, it stinks to be perfectly honest. Just be forewarned.<br />* Pricing of this is so much more economical versus prepared varieties. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some folks weren't just repackaging this and slapping their brand labels on it.<br />* The bonus to THIS particular liquid latex - it's black light reactive... so if you plan on going to an all-night rave anytime soon, you can wear this and you'll glow all night! lol ;)<br /><br />🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<br />Highly recommended and I will most definitely repurchase when I hit tub bottom. Thanks for reading!<br /><br />Seriously though, one more thing - In order to keep the latex fresh and from drying up, you should make sure to wipe any excess latex from around the neck of the jar. Keep the lid screwed on tight when not in use, and store it in a cool dry place.",1

I received shades from the recent Sinful Porcelain Matte collection (2016) and Carded collection (2016). I haven't tried all of them yet but I did inspect the bottles and none of them looked used. There was no spillage or leakage during transit and the consistency was as expected from Sinful np. Not all of the shades are to my taste but my daughter was happy to received the ones I didn't want. I ended up keeping about 8 of them for myself. Nice collection and I'm glad I purchased!,1

The colors are extremely vivid, and they pop, even on my darker skin. I'm a black eyeliner fanatic, and have been wanting to switch things up. I love the mix of colors, which includes average, everyday colors as well as colors appropriate for a night out. They aren't clumpy or runny, and they stay put nicely.<br /><br />The formula was a pleasant surprise. These pencils glide smoothly, even over eyeshadow and my waterline. The waterline is always a challenging area, because I tear up easily and often. I can create a sharp line or smudge it out, and either way, it wears extremely well. In one photo, I'm wearing black on the waterline and inner corner, and in the other, I'm wearing champagne on the waterline.<br /><br />I like that these liners each arrive sealed, but be aware that the plastic can be tough to get off, and also that the liners are extremely soft. I broke one unwrapping it, but luckily, they sharpen well, without constantly breaking. The quality, value, and variety of this set are excellent, overall...it's a win.",1

I don't want to give it a bad review because of my lack of ambition with it, but I don't want to lie and say that its an amazing product either. This Biotin Infused Zenlash Eyelash Growth Serum is definitely easy to use. It comes in a little wrapped bottle similar to a mascara bottle, except the brush looks more like a detail nail polish brush. The idea is simple, you brush it on your lash line everyday and wait and watch. It was a bit hard for me to get my lid closed all the way and brush this one, but I am not one who uses make up much either. If you do use make up it will probably come a lot faster for ya. I did accidentally get a bit in my eye before and I was happy to see, though it doesn't feel good, it didn't irritate me much either. I really wish I could say that I saw a huge transformation, but after only managing to use it for one straight week, I didn't see much difference.<br /><br />~Thanx~",1

Its like the action of a pore strip but more intense for your whole face. Its a thick black gel that you put on and it takes 30 min or so to dry on and then you peel it off. You have to hold your skin tight when peeling it off or it will hurt. It does sort of feel like its taking the top layer of skin off. My skin is sort of sensitive so some parts hurt to feel off but goodness the clarity it brings to your face and pores. I did this the day before a facial and the aesthetician even commented how clear it looked. She didn't even have to do extractions. I really like it and would buy it again.

After you shampoo your beard you basically strip it of oils and dirt. That is good but you have to replace the oils if you don't want the dreaded beard itch and dandruff. This stuff does a great job at replacing the striped oils. It keeps my beard happy and that helps keep me happy. I also enjoy the sent of this balm. It is a mild sent of citrus orange in my opinion. I have used others with less sent and some that are much stronger. This sent seems to leave about an hour after applying.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Natural ingredients<br />Good conditioning<br />Easy to use tin.<br />Easy to apply consistency<br /><br />Cons:<br />If I use it multiple times in day I started to get zits in certain areas.<br /><br />All in all.

The instructions tell you to wet the actual strip and then put it on your face, but I recommend keeping the strip dry and just lightly wet the area around your nose. I tried both ways and for some reason, wetting my face just worked much nicer. You also get 50 of them so thats a huge plus considering the price.<br /><br />Now the big question.....do they work?<br />Well. When I used it the two times, it dude pull out some small blackheads and looked like it did a decent job. I've always been a little skeptical of these kinds of products and I don't feel like it does that much in general. I kind of use these for placebo and catharsis. It's comforting to see these strips pull ANYTHING out of your skin, so it makes me feel better about it. But it is completely acne-clearing and black head cleansing? Not really.<br /><br />These are inexpensive, you get a bunch of them, and they are nice to use. I recommend it but if you have somewhat large pores and oily skin like me, don't expect much passed &#34;Oh.....well that's nice.&#34; I wish it did more. But these are okay.",0

Although the bottles are smaller than the ones they sell separately, I like that these come in a set, since they all work great together. I see that most reviewers love the scent of these. That is the only thing I don't particularly like. Although the scent is unisex, it smells a little too masculine for my preference, but that is just my own preference. I love the handy flip lids on the shampoo and conditioner and the sprayer is great for the thermal shield. A huge plus to me is when a product comes with tamper-proofing, which this set comes completely wrapped in plastic, so I know it has not been tampered with.<br /><br />The shampoo is rich and opaque and, just from the creaminess, I knew this would work well on my hair. The clear shampoos are usually not conditioning enough (in general), but the creamy ones, like this, are great. The conditioner is the same, very thick and rich, perfect for my wavy, dry, color-treated hair. It may weigh finer hair down a bit much, unless used more sparsely. The thermal shield helps keep my waves from becoming frizzy. It is lightly conditioning and softening. It sprays evenly and just the right amount.

Another con for me is the conditioner is very thin substance. I have long hair and because of the consistency it takes a lot more conditioner than I was hoping. It did not fade my color which is a plus!! And I have to brag about how much I love the heat spray. It doesn't leave my hair looking greasy or a weird sticky texture after straightening my hair.

You do not need to add water or anything to it. Just scoop out and massage onto skin and it turns into this weird foam. Let dry. Rinse. I didn't see any real GLOWING difference in my skin. I get the same kinda clean and fresh feeling from masks I have purchased at the drugstore. This gets a 5th star for the fun effect.,1

It is strong and it lasts all day. The bottle tucks easily into a bag or briefcase and the spray functions smoothly. I wish it either had a difference scent or was fragrance free.

AFA4KTTZ7IUXTMWGXKRYURISVNXA,B072L84514,5,2017-06-10 22:12:48.710,Works surprisingly well,"I've seen these steamer machines that are used to remove gel nail polish and while I've always wanted to try them, I was very skeptical and unwilling to spend the money on a gadget that may or may not work. But, removing the gel polish is the worst part or the thing I hate about gel polish: it's time consuming and so hard on the nail bed. I've seen mixed reviews online about gel polish steamers but I finally decided to try one.<br />This gel polish remover machine actually works. It was easy to put together and I was able to completely remove my gel polish in under 20 minutes. First and most important is to file the top layer of gel down first with a nail file before using this device. I was not able to get the gel polish offf without filing the surface first. I put about two capfuls of 100% acetone (you can use less) into the little tray and turned the machine on. Once it beeps, you can stick your fingers inside. It gets a little hot but it's not painful. After five minutes the machine will beep and I am able to scrape off most of the gel polish. I have to do a second round to get certain areas that just won't scrape off. And when I say scrape off, I mean easily scrape off not scraping and hurting the surface of the nail. I guess I should say push off the gel polish to remove it. I leave the remaining acetone in the tray and either reuse it or dump it. I would say this is easier than using aluminum foil or plastic nail caps because you do the whole hand at once. With foil or plastic caps, I never get my whole hand done at once. This was easier and I didn't use any cotton balls and I used less acetone.<br /><br />The device is a little pricey. It's basically a warming plate fitted inside a contained area with holes to place your fingers. It's worth the money to me because I hate the process of gel removal. I  like that the company provides four replacement plastic pieces for the nail holes. It took me a while to figure out what the replacement pieces were for but after reading one of the reviews I now realize what it's used for. There is also a second plastic tray to put the nail polish remover or acetone in. My only criticism is that I wish the device was smaller as I have a lot of nail stuff and this will just add to it all. It's not the fanciest looking device but it does the job.",1

It smells amazing, the lather is plentiful and silky, and I can genuinely say that my hair does feel a bit thicker.

Don't get me wrong...it's not an Earth-shattering change, but it's a step in the right direction.<br /><br />The reason this didn't get 5 stars is because every single shampoo bottle I have ever purchased has been faulty.

I have only used once because I only remove my nails once a month or longer if I can, but it was much.  Better than soaking or using foil or gloves.

AH5OTJDIHBG4SYLRYWKS7MR7NWUQ,B01NB1ZBA1,4,2017-08-28 11:45:31.931,Oz Naturals makes great products.,"Oz Naturals is a favorite go-to of mine for beauty products. I have tried many of their moisturizers, serums, and facial cleansers and am never disappointed.<br /><br />This is a one ounce glass bottle, pump action. Clear serum.<br /><br />Though I can't know what it does on a cellular level, really, I do know that using Oz products (along with other good skin care products and eating healthfully, along with exercise and good sleep, and genes - really, the stuff we put on our faces is only a part of good skin care) keeps my skin looking good. Many people can't tell my age, and that means I'm doing something right. So since Oz Naturals is also reasonably priced (under $18 at time of this reveiw), I feel good about purchasing it.<br /><br />What I wish is that it were easier to pump - it kind of jets out so it's more difficult to control how much you want.<br /><br />This is not a &#34;luxe feel&#34; type of serum, so be aware of that. It feels more dry (though not drying to your skin-there's just no sits-on-top-of-skin thicker feel that some serums have) after you put it on rather than with that emollient feeling some serums have. That's probably also because of the hydraulic acid quality in it. It's a serum blend of hydraulic acid, vitamin E, retinol, and other ingredients.<br /><br />I use this at night, applying it to my cleansed face. I wait a few minutes and then I apply my moisturizer.<br /><br />Love their product; love their company.",1

AH5OTJDIHBG4SYLRYWKS7MR7NWUQ,B074SQFWPV,3,2017-08-31 13:15:23.157,Okay but nothing special.,"A plastic jar full of lavender-colored and -scented bath salts. (Apparently some of my Pre De Provence products are showing up in one review - so while this reveiw is for bath salts, I have the lavender lotion as well, which I do love the scent of it but as with the bath salts, wish the bottle were nicer).<br /><br />There was no seal on the top of the jar, just the lid. That's fine, but I would wonder how long it would sit on a shelf before purchasing and how &#34;fresh&#34; the scent would last. That said, when I opened the lid and took a whiff, it was pretty powerfully scented. I like the lavender aspect but there's another scent there that I don't like and can't figure out what it is. It's off-putting. It doesn't linger in the water, so that's good.<br /><br />I sprinkled some in my bathroom sink that I'd filled with warm water. The water turned a slight lavender shade as the bath salts turned clear. The salt crystals did melt pretty quickly, though as with any bath salts I've used there are always a few that are stubborn.<br /><br />The water felt soft enough, I suppose-nothing really special, but that strong scent wasn't as apparent in the diluted water.<br /><br />I did think it a bit pricey at just under $17 (at time of this review). For that price, I'd like a glass bottle or something prettier in the jar design itself, though the lavender-colored crystals do look pretty. Still, there are plenty of bath salts out there that are half the price and smell about the same, so what would make me want to purchase this one exclusively? Something that made it attractive to me, and that would be a pretty bottle/jar that I could display in my bathroom in my basket of bath goodies. Or, to give someone as a gift.<br /><br />This plastic jar makes it seem like one of those cheaper jars of bath salts you can buy at Big Lots, which I can do for less than half the price if I want bath salts. Pretty it up some so I feel I'm getting my money's worth. You cold say Pre De Provence has quality ingredients and maybe that's why the price, but I'm not finding it special enough to pay almost $17.",0

My dermatologist said I needed to start using a retinol cream in my skin routine. I tried two others: one was very thing which I had to apply when my skin was completely dry. That one dried my face out so bad that I started to peel. The other was very thick. I used it morning and night and within a few days I developed cystic action. This product is not as thick as a cream but not runny like a lotion. It smells nice. I use it only once a day, usually at night. So far it doesn't break my skin out and it seems to absorb quickly. I put it on and go right to bed and my pillow cases are stained. For the price, I would buy this again. So far though, no drastic change in wrinkles.",1

In theory, I LOVE them, but the acetone evaporates before gel polish will dissolve... I'd buy the silicone &#34;Soakies&#34; instead and see if those do a better job at preventing the evaporation.  I haven't used these on regular nail polish because it comes off so easily anyway... so, If they don't last long enough to dissolve gels, I can't endorse them... I also tried wrapping the fingers in foils and using a regular thick cotton round ( both cut and folded).  Still, the acetone evaporated before the gel was coming off... and the very thin pads included wouldn't work AT ALL... I even took a bottle of acetone, warmed it  (carefully) in a pan of hot water & soaked cotton pads, wrapped fingers in foils & continually re-wetted with additional acetone... THAT finally worked, but by that point, I could have just done it without the clips.  And, for self-use they are less than worthless...  trying to get them on and keep working is comedic. Additionally, a lot of toes won't fit at all because the clips just aren't large enough.",0

I used this to clean ALL of my makeup brushes and it worked well for almost every single one. Each brush needs to be positioned a little differently for optimal cleaning depending on the shape and length of fibers. The only brushes that didn't work well were bulky face brushes with heavy handles that the machine did not spin well and small eyeshadow and detailing brushes that couldn't fan out. I recommend two rounds of rinsing. The first in soapy bubbly water to clean the brushes and the second in clean water only to rinse out any bubbles and residue.<br /><br />Even with two cycles, the process was quicker and less intensive than washing by hand and the drying time was cut down to almost nothing for nearly all my brushes, including dense synthetics.<br /><br />I highly recommend!",1

The next night, I use the Vitamin c with AHA and the Hyaluronic acid serums along with this one. I do wait about 10-15 minuites between each. But, I use the eye gel every night. They all work so well together and my skin is looking and feeling so much better. My biggest problems are large pores and uneven texture. My texture has evened out so much and my pores are surprising me more each day. I'd say these serums really have made the biggest difference in my pores.

AGKUVNELSMHKPBCPUKFFQ4XMS3OQ,B01GU2NME2,5,2017-12-01 08:29:13.638,Amazing!,I get lazy about cleaning my brushes but I’ve read too many horror stories lately about people getting bad infections from a dirty brush and have made it a priority to wash my brushes after each use. This set is perfect for that purpose. It’s a whole cleaning system in two-three easy steps. It uses less water and conserves shampoo. The drying straps are also very innovative and great for large brushes that can puff out and lose their shape after repeated washes. These cups are so much better than the mats.

The silver conditioner was my response. My husband, who is totally white haired also has been using the conditioner once per week. To keep the yellow out of his hair he shampoos and conditions purple once a week and this has been a positive addition to his routine.

Well, I do have &#34;nicer&#34; (aka at least more expensive, anyways) plates, and had gone through that whole phase w the bridal registry picks, fancy parties and such. Lately tho, I am back to ease of use, and simple living is far more important to me. I've been purchasing Corelle plates and bowls again, which I like to use the most, because nothing beats their lightweight and thin design, and I love their bright designs, like this newer South Beach pattern, which is just very Happy.

AGFHHZIEFIIXJZKWRCLKISPPFGWQ,B01J4P4VH4,4,2018-01-04 00:02:11.702,"A beautiful, natural, dewy finish..","Let me start by saying, I did NOT order this from Amazon.  I ordered it from Sephora.  The reviews here regarding whether this product was a fake or not made me a little leery.  So, I'm reviewing the real Josie Maran Vibrancy foundation and not the Amazon version, real or not.<br /><br />As usual, I ordered the lightest shade, RG5.  It's a nearly perfect match.  It's described as being for fair skin with neutral undertones.  I typically prefer foundations with pink undertones, but this actually worked really well for me.<br /><br />The consistency is on the thin, runny side, which isn't surprising since oil is an ingredient.  Having said that, this foundation sits on the skin so beautifully.  It looks like real skin.  It's definitely not a matte foundation, so if that's your preference, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation gives you more luminous, dewy-looking skin.  I don't typically care for dewy foundations, but again, I was surprised to like this one.  It just made my skin look healthy and plump.  It didn't look at all heavy, which is great because it didn't settle into my fine lines.  I did notice it took a while to set.  Again, not surprising considering the oil content, but you'll want to make sure you set it with powder before trying to blend blush/contour/bronzer, etc.  Otherwise, you'll likely look pretty streaky.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have mentioned a smell.  I didn't notice that at all, which is another reason I think the product people are buying here might not be legit.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because my t-zone gets oily fairly quickly while wearing it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for more mature skin and dry skin types.  If you're oily, you can definitely still wear it, you just might have to blot a bit more than usual.<br /><br />Overall, though, a great foundation.  Just make sure it's what you're looking for.  It's a very specific look.",1

However, this 'good' feeling/looks last just a few hours.<br />* Once open the container, there is no way to keep the lid down to keep it fresh for the next application. Packaging is awful.  The amount of the 'mask' in the little pouch/tub may last 2-3 application. (Maybe a week supply for the face regiment).  However, after you peel off the container, there is no way to keep it fresh.

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B078W6XC3C,5,2018-02-15 16:12:54.440,Best Battery Powered Brush We Have Ever Used Cleans As Good As Clarisonic Which We Also Have,"We have been through several Clarisonic brushes in our house (Mine kept dying) and my daughter swears by her Clarisonic Mia.  She has to go to a camp which has a lot of other teens at it for a week to work for a city reach out program.  She wanted to bring her Clarisonic, but I talked her into trying this one out.  It is easy to transport and use and if it is lost or taken, it is not as expensive to replace.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?<br />First of all, this comes in a nice hard case which is great for travel.  It comes with one soft brush for daily use and a harder brush for once a week or so use.  There is a silicone brush head which is for dry sensitive skin types.  The brush runs on batteries which did not come with our unit.  They are AA batteries.  There are two speeds- slower for daily use and higher for the harder brush to exfoliate.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT WORK?<br />There are two speeds.  The first speed is very slow and my daughter is not fond of it.  She prefers to use it on the second speed which is faster.  Since it runs on batteries, it is not going to have the consistency as a plug in version.  My daughter prefers the exfoliating brush and uses it 2 times a week.  She feels that it cleans her skin as good or better than her Clarisonic Mia as it gets rid of the dead skin cells leaving her skin softer and more clear too.<br /><br />It seems to be very waterproof.  My daughter uses this in the shower and has had no problems with it.  After almost a month of use, twice a week, she is not having problems with the batteries running down yet.  She does  a lot of house sitting so having this handy has been great.<br /><br />AFTER EXFOLIATING BRUSH<br />After using the exfoliating brush, my daughter wanted me to mention that it is important to put on good moisturizer as the skin has been exfoliated well and you will need to make sure to use moisturizer on the face to protect the skin as it repairs.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If you want the cleaning of a Clarisonic Mia but want something more travel friendly that cleans well, this might be a brush for you to try out.  Working best on the second speed with the exfoliating brush, twice a week does the trick for our daughter.  She really likes it and thinks it works as good or at times better than her Clarisonic Mia which she still has.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS for this one although it is not fair to grade it against the Clarisonic which is electrically powered, it works as well but does have the battery power.  I debated giving it four stars, but it does work better than any battery powered brush we have tested so far, so I am leaving it at five.  The soft brush is not too great, though, so perhaps see this as FOUR AND A HALF.",1

AEGMBU2PMHWHIYSTZNO2PD6YFNQQ,B077FFCS6F,4,2018-02-21 20:59:56.792,Very pretty finish,"These are made with a clever design to ensure you are putting them on correctly.  According to the enclosed instructions, you always wear them so that the heart part of the backs are on top when you slide them onto the post of your earrings.  This insures that the weight of the earring pulls the heart against your ear which, in turn, counterbalances the earring and holds it securely against your ear.  They're really lightweight, but they work well.  I tried them on my heaviest earrings to see just how securely these backs hold and they do not disappoint.  Even using them with lighter earrings you can tell they are held much more tightly and upright against your ear.  They are designed so you can tighten or loosen the clasp on them so they're adjusted just the way you want them.  A friend gave me a set of these for Christmas and I liked them so I bought more for myself and a couple more sets for my sisters to try.  I'm happy that this set is 18K gold plated sterling silver so I won't have any problems with allergies.  They are a great idea and they have a very pretty finish.",1

The first time I tried it, I ended up with a lot of hair that didn't make it into the clip.  In subsequent tries, I ended up with the hairs at the very top of my head sticking up or outside the clip, and finally I ended up with the clip too far up on my head which resulted in my hair looking like a literal pony's tail!

The key is to use the tape in extension that has tape already, and rather than sandwiching too tape in extensions together (too heavy for fine hair) you use the single sided tape for the other side. I watched many videos on how to do this and I did it myself and they feel fine. There aren't very many pieces in this package for the price, however. It's a bit expensive for only 48 pieces. I nearly used all of them for one application.<br />Update:  After a full month of having the extensions in. Over-all a good experience but will not order these tapes again.<br />I am changing my rating in follow up.  Impossible to remove without damaging hair. The glue warmed and leaked out the sides over time and caught my hair in the leaked glue. This shortened the length of time I could wear the extensions. I tried to use this one sided tape and it is very shiny, you can see the glimmer of the tape. Not shine free.  I would not use this on fine hair.",0

They are soothing and are perfectly suitable for my sensitive skin.  They are not stripping, and I've went through them without one single reaction to them (and my skin hates a lot of stuff).  I would definitely repurchase.<br /><br />Face wipes can't compare to truly washing your face with a cleanser; my skin (which needs it's exfoliation) is at it's best and most polished when I wash fully with a cleanser.  But life happens, and last nights happen, and face wipes are 1000% better than sleeping in your makeup.  They're also great for mornings when you don't really need the full cleansing routine, or as pre-wash makeup removed in the evening if you have on a lot of long wearing makeup.  So many uses, and wipes are a staple in my bathroom cabinet.  And these are some of the gentlest ones I've tried.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend for sensitive or dry skin.",1

I've been using it for a couple weeks now and I can't say I've noticed a marked difference in my skin. Perhaps my skin was already wonderful. :)<br /><br />I will say for a supplement, this is one of the best tasting ones I've tried. I am always on the look out for new supplements and vitamins, etc. and I really like to try new things to promote skin quality, hair and nail growth, etc. Often the powders or pills or liquids are pretty tough to choke down. I tried a different collagen powder that made me gag so I was kind of worried about trying this.<br /><br />This is a liquid, but not too viscose. It's thicker than water but easily drinkable and quite tasty. It's a sweet orange flavor. The package says you can add it to smoothies, but I just drink it straight. It does need to stay refrigerated which could be annoying depending on the space available in your refrigerator.<br /><br />I would probably give it 4 stars for the taste, but the price is so high, and since I haven't noticed a difference I felt I had to knock one more star off. 99 dollars is a lot of money.",0

These are nice and flexible, making removal super easy.  They can be reused, once you clean them and sanitize them with rubbing alcohol.  These are more square at the cuticle area, great for those with a more square shaped nail bed, my thumbs are pretty square.  They come in 10 sizes (10 of each size) and the sizes are reasonable sizing too.  I have dual forms from another brand and half of them are unreasonably HUGE, whereas these are for normal people.  For my thumb I used size 2 and my other fingers fit 4-8.  They came in a plastic organizer case that is way smaller than my other case, so they don't take up a ton of room in my nail station.  The latch on mine didn't close tight, so I had to use a piece of tape, but I'm not taking off any stars because that didn't affect the usefulness of the product itself.  All in all, the C curve was perfect, easy to load, cure and pinch off.  I found these to be perfect for anyone who wants a square cuticle line, rather than a round one.

It should also be noted that there’s two different options in the heavy cream line. This tube is body butter. The smaller tube available in this scent is hand repair balm. I personally received the hand repair balm as an Ipsy sample. The formula is slightly different for the hand balm.",1

I have thick, heavy hair that has been really long for more than 40 years and no combs were ever able to hold its weight.  A few years ago I cut my hair shorter.  Right now it's shoulder length; not quite long enough to put in a pony tail but too long to keep it easily out of my face.  I hoped these combs would be a good interim solution and I absolutely loved the color and flash of the rhinestones.<br /><br />With care, and holding onto the bottom part of my hair tightly while we place the combs, we can get them to hold my hair for a few hours (see photo) but then it starts to fall out unless we put the comb toward the top of my head.

It's cheap, flimsy, and holds light items. Items have a tendency of tilting outward in the pockets depending on the size of the item and are at risk of falling out. The detachable clear plastic tote at the bottom is a nice touch, but that is about it. The zippers are sticky.<br /><br />In my opinion this cosmetic / travel organizer will not last at all. My biggest complaint is the hook for hanging. It is not a full-size hanger hook so there are a limited number of places to hang this. It can be hung on a wire shelf with holes (like a shower caddy or closet with wire inserts) but it does not hang on a shower rod or on a closet rod or any rod much thicker than a finger.<br /><br />This cosmetic bag is not even worth consideration in my opinion.",0

My only problem with it is the eyeliner arrived broken so I had to throw it out. The pump for my setting spray didn't work as well which isn't that big of a deal because I had a working pump on my old one that fit it. Things like this are the main reason I've always been hesitant to buy make up online but for the price this was just too good to pass up.

A great feature when you're using is regularly.<br /><br />My sister, who has been a professional for 20 years, said it was among the sharpest (in a good way!) she's ever used.  Obviously this is huge when working on customers and you don't want to pulling hair out when you're trying to cut it.<br /><br />With the myriad attachments, there's really very little you can't do with it.

Like many reviewers, I was put off by the sheer amount of packaging that came along with this item. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't tout how conscious they were of environmental issues, but I've purchased Chanel with less packing, come on!<br /><br />All of the beauty and skin care products I consume are luxury, at the moment I've been using Dr. Gross's skin care line but until I could get back to Sephora, I've been using Purity cleanser.  I was hoping this product would be a suitable replacement but I'm not convinced so let me tell you about the photos.<br /><br />Each night I cleanse my face with Purity using Clarasonic's Uplift with the Revitalizing brush.  I follow this with micellar water (by Borghese) and then a serum and moisturizer.  The whole thing takes about 7 minutes (it's therapy, don't judge!).<br /><br />Upon waking, I swabbed my face with the micellar water and then took a picture of the cotton ball along with an untouched cotton ball for comparison.  And by the way for the uninitiated, micellar water is the best skincare product to come out since mascara was invented.  I was sure that my $349 Clarasonic erased all traces of dirt no matter the soap, but the micellar water never lies.<br /><br />On the second morning, first thing, I used the Clarasonic with the Radiance brush and three pumps of LaClaire Foaming Botanical Facial Cleanser.  Two pumps did not create a bit of lather.

I received this product as a trial, and I was amazed by the reults. The pump and foam action makes application easy, and the soap goes on smoothly and feels great. The scent is mild and pleasant, which is a real plus given that I tend to be hypersensitive to strong odors.

All of the shimmers are highly pigmented and the matted come out great on the eye. The more vibrant shimmers do have a lot of fallout so I'd suggest using a shadow shield or doing your foundation and concealer after so you can cover it up. Also I would highly recommend using your finger or a sponge tip brush to apply the shimmers and pack on the color.",1

This is a foaming cleanser and when mixed with water, the consistency is rather thick. I suffered from breakouts all over my forehead during the week or two using this cleanser which is a very unusual spot for me to break out. I had some other treatments affecting my hormones at the same time, so I can't say for certain that my skin condition was due to this product alone, but it certainly didn't help.

When they're moisturized they don't fall off as fast, and putting on mascaras certainly aid in drying out the lashes.  I try the oil-on-the-lashes thing but I've made the decision to stop using this product.",0

It came with a couple of colors, but she is thrilled to have this nice variety of colors now. The quality of the nail polish is comparable to other gel nail polishes that we have bought. It works as it should. She has polished her nails once so far with this set. As of now, it's been one week and they all look as good as the first day. Usually gel polish lasts for about 2 weeks on her, so at this rate, she thinks the results will be the same. One thing she didn't like was that the bottles are not labeled or marked to indicate what colors they are. To solve this, we put a drop of nail polish on the back of each bottle. The polish wouldn't dry without the LED light, which we realized after 5 hours of waiting. So we took a piece of clear tape and covered the polish drop. So now she can easily identify the right bottle without having to open each one.",1

I got a cheap UV light at WallyMart which sounds easy.  They were out and I had to wait a week for a shipment to get in.  Such first world problems.<br /><br />I use the grayish color, not that you can see the colors by looking at the bottles. I did this during the day with a light so I could carefully put it on without getting and on my skin.  That sounds easier than it was, too.  I made a mess on two toes an had to whip out the acetone. When I got the gel right, it was more a user error than the polish, I whipped out the UV light.  I guess it look okay. After it cures, I does have a gel look to it.  I did put on a topcoat of regular polish to get a better shine.<br /><br />Yes, I have to wear shoes and nobody will really see it, but I'll know it's there.",1

I assume this is because the polishes are light sensitive and so the black bottles protect all of them from degrading due to harsh lighting. As a result, you aren't able to tell one from the other unless you open each one and then mark down the numbers for your reference.<br /><br />I like the look of the red and gray finishes more than the others, but to dry your nails fully you have to purchase a LED nail lamp. I didn't have one especially made for nails but I had a table lamp that uses LED. It worked, but I'm sure if I used the LED Nail lamp the drying time would have been faster.<br /><br />The colors are vibrant and I like the glossy finish. There hasn't been any serious chipping or loss of polish for a week now, but I've used other gel polishes that have lasted almost as long as the LED kind.  And for those who like to change their polish often, preserving the same look for a week or two isn't a priority.

AE3IGJOPJP6LFXEJTIXFJVSJLILA,B07F8PCLDV,4,2018-11-30 19:29:18.063,Not bad but there are better choices,"This is the 2nd hair straightener I've had the opportunity to try.  The other is the Furiden Professional Hair Straightener Titanium Flat Iron.  I'm going to write this review as a comparison between the two since they are in the same price range.  For starters, both heat up quickly, have variable temperature settings, automatic shut off and a swivel cord.  The Autenpoo (who comes up with these brand names???) brand has a mechanical on/off switch that also serves as the heat selector.  I prefer this over the Furiden which has on/off buttons and up/down buttons to set the temp on a digital screen.  If I want, I can leave the Autenpo's dial set on the temp I want (the lowest setting it has), unplug it when I'm done, plug it in the next day and it will just turn on and go to my favorite temp.  With the Furiden, I have to hold a button down to turn it on and then hit the down button 4 or 5 times to go to the lowest temp.  The Autenpoo also comes with a comb, some hair clips to section your hair during styling and a heat protective glove, and has a slide lock to keep it shut when not in use.  In all other aspects however, I prefer the Furiden.  Autenpoo's cord is super thick bulky, seriously like a vacuum cleaner cord.  It will probably last forever but adds unnecessary bulk and weight which would be especially problematic for traveling.  The main advantage Furiden has is the pointed end.  Not only is it better suited to tight areas close to your scalp or neckline but it can also help section your hair without needing a comb or your fingers.  Furthermore, the plates, which are longer overall, extend into the pointed tip to get the heat right where you need it.  Both of these irons do a perfectly fine job, but I just find the Furiden easier to use.",1

I haven't tried this particular tresemme before, but I really like it. It works great like the other varieties I have tried.

However it doesn't make my hair feel too stripped nor does it feel too greasy/oily after using both shampoo and conditioner, and my hair doesn't feel too dirty too fast, as with some conditioners.  The shampoo is clear and the conditioner is creamy.  This is a readily available brand, not a fancy salon brand, but it works well for me, and has no parabens, dyes, or silicones.",1

I use a different section for the next day and toss the cloth in the wash at the end of the week.  I confess, that I don't normally wash my face at night.  I hate using those prepackaged make up remover wipes.  Single-use disposable products seem wasteful and environmentally unfriendly to me in general plus they are just like a cold slap on your face right before bed.

I put one of each down in the guest room.<br /><br />What I like the best about this shampoo is the scent. Really pleasant, and for me, not too strong. It’s a lovely scent that’s not too coconutty. The scent of it would have me use it just to have my hair smell great.<br /><br />As for what it does and how it works: I don’t find this shampoo to be any better than many shampoos I use—I have my favorites that I regularly use that work well with my hair. This Tresemme Botanique shampoo and conditioner didn’t weight down my super baby fine hair, so that was great. My hair was shiny afterwards, so that was great as well.<br /><br />It’s a good shampoo with a nice scent that cleansed and conditioned my hair decently.<br /><br />One thing I wish—since the bottles are so big, a pump dispenser would have been so much easier to use. I think I will pour some of each into a smaller bottle with a pump dispenser and put the bigger bottles in the cabinet. They really are way too big to sit in my shower/tub area. It’s kind of like they are for refillable bottles.<br /><br />If you like the Tresemme brand, then you’ll be happy with this shampoo and conditioner. The price is reasonable for how much you are receiving, the scent is lovely, and it does a decent job of cleansing your hair (there are an awful lot of suds lathering, so I don’t know if that’s good or bad).",0

Most of the time they don't cut right, or they just don't last.  Toenail clippers- well it is even harder to find a decent pair.  Let's see how this set measured up for us..<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS NAIL CLIPPER SET LIKE?<br />This set comes with a hefty set of nail clippers.  It says it is for fingernails and toenails.  More on that in a minute.  The clipper comes with a catch all for the clippings.  It also comes with a faux leather snap shut case that also houses a nail file.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE CLIPPER PERFORM?<br />These clippers are surprinsingly nice.  I tried them on both finger and toe nails and they worked very well.  I did not get any ragged edges, or dull bent nails or anything else that I usually have problems with regarding most clippers.  I did even have good results on the thickest nail which is on the largest toe.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT NOT BENEFIT BY THESE CLIPPERS?'<br />The only person I would think would not benefit from these are those who deal with very thick elderly nails.  Those need special clippers.<br /><br />THE NAIL FILE<br />The nail file is nice, very fine grade of file, this files nails decently.  The tip is not overly great at cleaning under the nail but it works okay.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This nail clipper seems to work well on finger and toe nails not having any trouble with ragged edges or dull bending of nails.  The enclosed case is great in that it keeps the file and clippers together.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS. I like the whole set although the nail file could be a bit better.",1

There is a tiny instruction pamphlet included.<br /><br />The flat iron feels good in my hands. I like that the cord swivels at the base so that it does not tangle.<br /><br />This did an okay job on my hair. I have fine medium length hair and this mostly relaxed my curls so that my hair was more wavy that fully flat. I set the temperature to 300 for fine hair. I also tried 350.<br /><br />There are several things that make this iron just okay for me. First, it is weird to have the temperature controls between the flat iron blades. There is a constant temperature key and also temperature plus and minus keys, in case the constant temperature key is not set.<br /><br />The power button should be pressed to start setting the temperature and then when the LCD stops flashing, it has reached that temperature. Then the power button has to be pressed again so that the light in the middle of the plate lights up.<br /><br />The plates have some space between them and they are offset a bit from each other which is the biggest annoyance to me. I guess this is why it straightened my hair only so much. This is not a bad flat iron but it is not perfect either.",0

The first one that I bought was much larger than this and I found it to be a bit awkward at times. Plus the end that rolls around the eyes was a static piece, not a roller. Then I tried a smaller one more recently. It was fine, until the eye roller piece broke off. The metal piece that holds it in never felt really sturdy and when it broke, I wasn't really surprised. This one is the nicest one I've tried. It's a great quality and very sturdy. The size is perfect. The directions say to chill it in the refrigerator, but I have found that it's usually cold enough just leaving it out on my bathroom counter. I use it primarily to help my serums and creams absorb into my skin better. This comes with another tool, a Gua Sha, which I was unfamiliar with.

While this brand of towels do the job, it takes a little bit more wiping and pressure to get the makeup off when I compare it to my more expensive ""Miracle Face Eraser"" brand towel. The texture is very similar but these are slightly more soft. I immediately could feel the difference so I had to see if they worked just as well. My miracle erasing brand is less soft, and has more friction. I believe this friction makes the makeup come off easier. If you want something super cheap, these will get the job done, but just know that they're not the best towels out there. They are still able to remove my waterproof liquid eyeliner and mascara which is exactly what I need them to do. Highly recommend these towels.

There's plenty of product to use each fragrance for awhile. (You can really get to know the aromas this way. It's not a one-and-done type of sampler.)<br /><br />All four fragrances are pleasant, clean, and crisp. My partner likes Oxford Bleu and Riviera the most. He says these have a ""fresh"" smell to him. (I agree!.

You are getting four fragrances- rated 4 and 5 STARS all in one box. The fragrances rated by me are based on my years spent working in a cosmetic factory. I will list each fragrance separately.<br /><br />ARROGANT- With top notes of bergamot and cedar you get a woodsy freshness to the scent. The middle notes of coriander and lavender bring a warm, clean freshness. At the base are sandalwood, amber and musk bringing a warm, sensual, spicy scent. All together, you get a spicy, warm, woodsy scent with a distinctive freshness to it. This light, sensual scent lasts all day and smells wonderful on almost every man, so 5 STARS.<br /><br />OXFORD BLEU- The top notes of mint and lemon add a citrus freshness. The middle notes of iris and geranium bring a very light floral scent. The base adds sandalwood and vanilla for a woodsy delicious scent. All together, this scent is light, with an undertone bit of floral and clean citrus and a nice light woodsy smell. This light, woodsy fragrance smells fabulous on almost every man and does last long for 5 STARS.<br /><br />RIVIERA- With top notes of lemon, bergamot, lime and cedar, you get a refreshing citrus/woods scent. In the middle are jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, lavender and mandarin- most of these were used in the 60's sexy, warm, earthy scents. At the base notes are nutmeg and coumarin to add some spice. This is not for every man, but for a man who likes a more vibrant scent. These scents are very noticeable and not light, being a very woodsy, earthy, warm fragrance with a touch of zest. 4 STARS.<br /><br />NOTTING HILL- The top notes begin with bergamot, lemon and lime for a clean, natural scent. Then the middle notes have bolder peppercorn and jasmine bringing a rose/herbal scent. At the bottom are cedarwood, sandalwood, amber and a powdery musk for a very potent woodsy, animal musky scent. This is definitely not for every man being very heavy scents. There is nothing light about this fragrance. 4 STARS.<br /><br />With four interesting fragrances, two being light and two being heavy, every man is sure to find one he will like. Lighter scents always smell wonderful on almost every man and the bolder scents smell great on a man depending on how his chemistry goes with the bolder fragrances. 4 ½ STARS.",1

I had a eyelash grower product that seemed to work for me before, so I thought I would give this one a try.  My previous one stressed to only apply once per day, before bed; this one encourages you to apply twice per day.  I started with once at bedtime but then began adding mornings too.<br /><br />This definitely seems to work for me!  Now, if you are expecting full, lush lashes, I think that's unlikely--at least that's not what happened for me.  For me, this product added length but not really any fullness.  And the length is mainly noticeable when I use mascara--my lashes actually hold the mascara and look significantly longer.  Also, it only takes a week or two to see results!  My only complaint is that this is a tiny tube, and after just a few weeks, there doesn't seem to be much product left.  Still, overall I really like this product and would recommend it!<br /><br />UPDATE 1/18/19:<br />I am still using this product, although I think I might be getting to the end.  It is still giving me longer lashes.  I attached a photo to provide an idea of how it works for me.

A courtesy card from the company thanking you for purchasing the product even includes a quote about how great mothers are from singer Stevie Wonder!<br /><br />Overall this is a very useful product that will save a parent money from taking your little one to the barber shop or hair salon. It works well and I can't see why it can't be used for an adult's hair as well, though the small size made it clear that is meant for a child's small head.",1

I have no idea how it works as well as it does, but somehow it has more ""grip"" on makeup than a normal washcloth, while being 100 times softer (and not having that horrible ""microfiber"" feel). I love wiping my face off with this warm cloth each day, and am always surprised how it even removes 95% of my waterproof mascara. I've compared eyemakeup removal by using this on one side and my liquid ""eye makeup remover"" on the other, and the two sides typically look nearly the same, though I look a teensy bit better on this side... so if I follow up by removing the rest of the mascara the usual way, I usually only get a teensy bit of grey on the Q-tip (rather than the usual solid black I get when I haven't pre-treated with this cloth). So it's not 100%, but I'm astonished that it gets more than 3% of the waterproof stuff off, since usually that won't budge.  So what can I say... it seems to work, and it's probably the most enjoyable part of my wind-down routine at the end of my day.",1

I definitely love the 'sunset/rose gold' palettes, and this reminds me of a Huda palette I have with similar shades. It's in a slim, cardboard palette without a mirror, but this is a lower price point for all the shades you get. The shadow itself is a creamy powder blend, and it suggests that you use your fingers for the metallic shades (I find a small crease blush works fine and tends to have less loose powder that way).<br /><br />You have a nice mix of matte and metallic shades this way, with a lot of earth tones. Definitely a lot of copper and reds here, some golds and rose golds and pinks. Colors that will stand out but not all of them. These felt nice on the skin and blended well. Why the three stars?<br /><br />I tried this with and without primer, and this kit definitely needs primer to last more than a couple of hours on my skin. Also? The mattes will last several hours, but not the metallics even with primer (as well as a setting spray on top). I love the metallic colors, but they just fade on me somehow - even if I layer them on top of the matte. I'm used to eyeshadow blending on me after a few hours, but never have I seen metallics melt away on me like this. That's not to mean it won't work better on other people.<br /><br />Still, for the price it's a nice range of colors and a fun palette to play with, so it's worth a try.",0

I like the fact that they charge from a USB port and come with a nice little pouch big enough to hold the clippers and accessories so you can slip the whole shebang in a dryer when not in use.

I used Glo Pro regularly for about 2-1/2 months, 2-3 times a week. I’m 57 and felt my skin did look particularly good with regular use. While results weren’t dramatic in that my wrinkles didn’t magically disappear, I feel the overall appearance of my skin seemed brighter, firmer and some lines seemed less noticeable. Around my eyes and cheeks aren’t big problem areas (except dark circles), but my fine lines looked virtually nonexistent in those areas and I feel I looked more refreshed and my skin looked more taut. The frown lines by my mouth are my worst issue and those didn’t improve as much as I hoped, but I did think the lines seemed less noticeable and the area seemed less saggy or firmer to me.<br /><br />I decided to take a break of about a month to see if I stopped if I’d notice a difference.  I don’t think my skin looks as good as it did when using Glo Pro regularly. I feel I look less refreshed, my frown lines look worse and my skin seems kind of dull. I can’t speak to the science of whether micro needing really increases collagen production (or if it can damage the skin), or if my benefit is because it increases absorption of my arsenal of serums and creams. But I do think I looked better from use and my skin doesn’t look as good since I stopped. It’s a tool that I’ve gone back to using, and I do really like using a lot.  I apply quality serums and creams within 60 seconds of using Glo Pro and do think I get bigger benefits from my products. I personally avoid using AHA and retinol products after Glo Pro as they’re too irritating for my sensitive skin.<br /><br />I don’t find Glo Pro painful to use. The needles feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it’s not uncomfortable or painful and hasn’t caused me any excessive redness, irritation or bleeding. I’ve seen videos of bleeding caused by micro needling done by professionals and read that going that deep isn’t required for micro needling to work. I only use Glo Pro at night and never wake with any redness or irritation. I do use the Glo Pro Pads after I cleanse to sanitize in order to avoid bacteria spread as I got a few blemishes after I ran out but don’t get blemishes using the pads (and alcohol is much too harsh for my dry skin).  I always keep the included spritz bottle filled with alcohol and spray the head after every use. While subjective, I do feel my skin looks better from using Glo Pro regularly with good treatment products and rate it 5 stars.",1

NOT Extra Soft,"First and foremost, the brushes I received are marked ""SOFT"" not ""Extra Soft"" as product title says.  I received eight (8) brushes in two sealed packaged of four (4) each.  I actually like the fact that the OEM Oral-B brushes are all in individually sealed packaging when you buy them in bulk.  I just think the individual packaging lends itself to the brushes remaining sterile until they are ready to be used.  I did notice some difference in the overall quality of the brush heads in comparison to the OEM heads.  The description refers to flossing action bristles; but the OEM Oral-B actually have several rubber flossing bristles amongst the other bristles.  These replacement brushes do not have the specialized flossing bristles.  But, all in all, these brushes seem to do a good job of cleaning my teeth at a FRACTION of the OEM cost.  They fit my Oral-B toothbrush body well, they stay in place, and they agitate properly.  Although the quality is not identical, these brush heads are a VERY GOOD option for a budget-conscious household.",1

AHCSOINU2KOXVBOAXKZHGSXZAEFA,B07DPKZPRH,5,2019-01-11 22:50:24.083,This flat iron is MAGIC!!,"As you can see, my “before” hair is very badly damaged: drugstore dye every 3 weeks, regular exposure to the AZ sun/heat & pool chlorine, plus I haven’t gotten a haircut in nearly 2 years so my split ends have split ends. Yet this little flat iron somehow makes my abused, frizzed-out hair look smooth, shiny, and healthy! It also feels very soft, with nice movement & body. The photos have not been edited aside from brightening up my bad bathroom lighting, and I did not use any oils, sprays, or other product in my hair after the usual shampoo & conditioner. It took me approximately 6 minutes to style, not including time for the iron to heat up (it’s pretty fast, I just didn’t time it).<br /><br />I dare say it might even work better than the $129 “professional” flat iron I got at a beauty supply store, though my old iron has been with me for 12 years so it definitely has some wear & tear. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering the very reasonable price for this one! The only minor drawback is the awkward control buttons, which are inside the handle & close to the hot plates, though I have not burned myself using them (yet). They’re also a little confusing and I have no idea what the strip of “infrared” lighting inside one plate is supposed to accomplish. So, I sought out the enclosed instructions and found this paragraph (verbatim):<br /><br />“Amino-bond is produced with the photosynthesis of ambipolar light of 68000Hz(wave length 680nm) and the elemental amino acid made up of the horny layer of hair so that the hair fiber and its elasticity will be restored, the hair squama gap will be densified again and the cellularity and squama gap will be restored.”<br /><br />Sooo...yeah. No idea what any of that means! But I really can’t argue with results. You definitely will not find a better flat iron at this price point. I’d give it 10 stars if I could!",1

Heat's up almost instantly... maybe about a minute...

Granted, I have wavy hair so I expect it to take a while... this flat iron worked great with two times going over the section of hair. There is an auto shut off feature, which is a must for me. The neatest thing is the design of this iron... if I wanted to curly ringlets, I could by wrapping it around the plate...",1

It has a long swivel cord that helps maneuver the iron while styling and infrared heat that ensures even distribution.  I have naturally straight hair but use a flat iron to calm the frizz from humidity.  I start with spritzing a heat protectant spray from roots to ends all over my hair and I dry my hair with a hairdryer until it is damp.  I do not recommend using this flat iron when your hair is still dripping with water. When your hair is damp you will see steam.  I was afraid it would damage my hair, but I have found that when I straight iron it when it is still damp the style holds longer and it seems shinier.  The iron heats up quickly with a 30-second heat up time and stays hot for an hour before the auto shut off feature kicks in.  The ceramic plates glide nicely through my hair and leave it ""de-frizzed"" all day.  The iron comes in a drawstring sack that makes storage easy.",1

But what I disliked about this flat iron is that the on/off switch in inside. They are push button too and not just a click/slide. Thought this was strange. While it's no unusual to have the switches inside, I found them more difficult to access on this iron. It's not uncommon to have the on/off on the outside and the heat control on the inside. I like the thinness of it though and it heats up fast enough. No issues there. It does its job. It just didn't hit my favorite flat iron list.",0

Let me tell  you - this is a headband style crown and absolutely gorgeous! It looks much more expensive, it is sparkley and highly detailed. I love the chain details that go over the forehead. It does not look anywhere like real diamonds - but more like good quality costume piece. My first photoshoot with this crown was a child model portrait session - and it did not disappoint. What I love about it that it is a headband style - it is slightly flexible - so it can fit adult or child head just fine. It does pinch a little if tilted forward, but if worn over the top of the head - it is fine. This can be dressed up many ways - as a princess, flapper, belly dancer and more.. I really love this headpiece and will definitely use it for more creative photoshoots and for my own costume.",1

I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!",1

I used stronger pressure from an air compressors to blow the dust out and it came out, however, it’s not sucking the air like it did when I first got it.<br />Solution? Buy more filters even if it hasn’t  been 2-3 months I thought it may be good to rotate out 3 different filters daily and use the air compressor on the filters once a week. It’s still not sucking the air well. I’d avoid this at all cost. $69.99 on the dust collector,  $19.99 on the replacement filters. My clothes are covered in dust. Do not purchase! Waste of money.",0

I follow the instructions to a t, applying only at night onto clean lash/brow hair and allow to dry completely before going to bed. The results are excellent. Within a week, most of the sparse patches in my lashes had begun to fill. Within two weeks, the short lashes were almost the same length as all the others. I am noticing longer existing lashes that are less prone to breakage and new growth in my brows as well. I have very sensitive skin and have a ridiculous amount of allergies to product ingredients and this has caused zero issues for me. I will definitely be repurchasing.",1

I wear a lot of liquid lipsticks, mascara, brow pomade, and other products that can be difficult to remove. I’ve never used the on-brand version of this makeup remover towel, so I can’t compare. I followed all the instructions, and these just plain didn’t work. It made my skin feel raw from rubbing, but somehow it grabbed none of the makeup from my face, except it smeared my foundation around. I’m very disappointed with these towels.

You can wet the brush and use it on a foundation for a dewy effect or use it dry for a matte effect. You can also use it dry to apply a setting powder or a blush.

You merely push a button on the side--one to use the curler, the other one to use the flat iron. It comes with a travel bag/pouch. I think it's a great deal for the price.

In this case I didn't notice any ill after effects - the Tourmaline Ceramic plates are designed to be softly reactive to your hair, so this may be the reason. The best advice I can give is to be aware of the heat settings - I typically use the lowest and work my way up depending on how my hair reacts.<br /><br />Like most flat irons by Parwin, it heats up fast and has a swivel cord. Given how many flat irons there are on the market, I would say this is OK in terms of what it does for the price.

There are and lotions (called serums in today’s beauty parlance). And, there are surgeries and injections, peels and a myriad of other things to try that may or may not work. Fine lines and wrinkles are going to happen, folks. You can work to minimize them, but, short of stretching the skin as taut as a drum, they are going to occur. Now, the gua sha roller and scraper may make a difference. Used after a good washing and a rub of whatever moisturizing emollient followed by rubbing gently with the roller or scraper simply feels very nice. The quartz is cool and soothing to the skin, and definitely stimulates circulation. It is a pleasant routine and provides the luxury of a spa in your own home.

What I like about this one is that it goes down to 80C (176F).  It was so cool that I was not sure it was on.  I have fine hair, high porosity that is 5 months post-straightening relaxer.  And, I find that light heat with a silicone-based glosser helps to gently close the cuticle and to keep my roots from tangling.  What I don’t like is that this brush design does not have the round guiding bristles around the edges that help to pull your hair into the hearing plate.  So, it feels like you are brushing your hair with your elbow and that it is not penetrating to the roots.  You have to grip the hair with your other hand so it feels like you are only getting the shaft of your hair.  So, the brush is best for people with longer hair who do not have curly roots or those who need the super low heat setting as an option.<br /><br />If you would like to be able to rake the brush over your roots to tame curls at 250 F and up, other bushes  to consider are https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FGV9NQG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1 or https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071HFQGJX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.  Note - My glamfields brush malfunctioned after first use which is why I ended up trying this one, but I decided to give Glamfields another chance because it is great when it works - never had results like that before.  The BuTure mini is like the Glamfields brush but smaller.  Both feel better (more like a real brushZ) than this one.",0

This doesn't happen with Cremorlab. Moreover, Cremorlab's essence absorbs better than SKII. (SKII can bead up slightly, so you have to work harder at pressing it into your skin).

I typically take my time and use it at night before bed. However, I wanted a unit on my main floor bathroom for quick use during the day without having to go back upstairs, or for use if I am going to be gone all day and want to take it with me. Therefor I have been keen on getting a portable chargeable flosser. That, and my first floor bathroom is super tiny with nowhere to put a typical flossing unit nor anywhere to plug it in. This is perfect for me!<br /><br />Nice unit, right out of the box. It is attractive, feels comfortable in the hand, as is easy to get it going. While it comes with instructions, it is easy to figure out- very intuitive. USB cord is good length. The port that plugs into the unit has a pop-in cover (""anti-fouling rubber stopper""). It doesn't come attached, and I wish it did since I'd rather not have that area exposed to water. I sense that I will lose that cap soon enough, or just forget to use it.

Good sized water reservoir, too.<br /><br />Unlike my main unit, this one has a fairly straight nozzle in comparison. This makes it a challenge to get behind the rear most molars. If the nozzles were a little longer, with slightly more curve than it has, I would consider this a perfect product.",1

AEHOFUNZP6VT74RUDDCJ2VVIT56A,B07LCHCD6Q,4,2019-04-22 22:09:06.993,Good so far,"I am one of those who prefer water flossers to string-based flossing. Process is much cleaner and, in my view, cleaning is more thorough.<br />This Chinese designed and made unit works well. You fill it with warm water, select the mode, possibly select a specific pick - but I always use the regular one - and you start flossing away.<br />Item design and ergonomics are generally Okay. However, the manual is not exactly helpful but most of us should be able to figure it out, eventually. Charging is via a custom USB cable but there is no actual charging unit so you need to find one such as your phone charger. You only need to charge it once every couple of weeks if you use it once daily.<br />Overall, a useful item and it does appear to be durable. Time will tell.",1
AGCQR2QLP3XWU64TBYFJCAZWQQKQ,B073CW1R4T,5,2019-04-22 23:28:32.037,"Easy to use and wash out, not for long hair",This product is actually really cool and just as easy to use in real life as it seems like in the pictures. Comes with a silvery tone putty type substance in a little container all you have to do is put your hands in kind of rub it around your hands and then run it through your hair. It was really the easy to do on someone else but takes a little bit more time to do on yourself though if you get some on your skin or ears or wherever you can just take a wet damp towel or a white or something like that and wipe it right off. In the picture that shows you doing it too long hair but I tried it on my long hair and absolutely did not work I could not pull a comb through it and it was hard and strange and it definitely works better on men's hair that is short. When it was dry it got kind of hard like a gel or something like that. It's really easy to make it look nice you just have to continue working it through the hair until you get the desired color and style that you want. We tried it on a beard as well and it didn't look as good on the beard it kind of looked better on the medium to short hair but not super super short like a beard. We even used it and my boyfriend's hair who is African-American and it came out pretty cool. Kind of makes you look like you have silver gray hair. It was really easy to wash out renting it out just with water gets a lot of it off but a little bit of shampoo get it out in just a second. I don't recommend going to bed with this in your hair as it will leave silver glimmery stuff on your pillowcase to make sure you wash before going to sleep or laying down on anything.,1

AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,B07LCHCD6Q,4,2019-04-26 01:52:37.316,Relatively strong water flosser but reservoir is attached which makes drying it nearly impossible,"I have used various countertop water flossers in the past such as the countertop WaterPik and the [[ASIN:B07HRNGS3Q Truwell Handheld Water Flosser]].  I love the idea of a hand held irrigator and this does work to remove most stuck debris from between the teeth. What is nice about this one over the other handheld I tried, is that there is very little splash back. However, I personally do not like that the reservoir is not removable for drying.<br /><br />IN THE PACKAGE<br />- One reservoir attached to handheld flosser unit<br />- One USB cable (wall adapter NOT included)<br />- One instruction manual<br />- One standard jet nozzle<br />- One orthodontic nozzle (larger brush)<br />- One pocket nozzle (smaller brush)<br />- One tong scraping nozzle (what looks like a spoon)<br /><br />I charged the unit fully before use. The white light on the side blinks when charging and remains steady when it is fully charged. Note the charging port is hidden behind a silicone nub below the grip dots on the top of the unit. Be careful to cover the charging port with this nub when the flosser is in use.<br /><br />There is an on/off switch and a mode switch. The three water pressure modes are soft, standard, and massage can be cycled through using the mode switch prior to turning the unit on. The jet tip (or any of the other three tips) gets inserted into the top. Be careful to make sure it is seated with the notch in the groove as the first time I put it in the hole, I did not have it seated all the way. To eject, press the release button to the left side.<br /><br />The reservoir IS NOT removable. Instead water enters through the small opening on bottom through which one has to fill the unit. I do not like that the reservoir is attached as I have to drain the remaining water out of that hole and leave the door open for drying. Also, the little button through which the water enters can easily break after lots of use. I personally would prefer not to have to use that hole.<br /><br />I held my mouth almost totally closed during use and tried all three modes. I did not have splash back, which was very nice. Splash back is usually typical of almost any type of water flosser so to some extent I was surprised. This flosser does work to dislodge most debris between teeth but not everything because it is not super powerful but is powerful enough. I am also impressed that the manual is relatively well written; kudos to the manufacturer on this. Normally, I feel as if I am reading Pig Latin when I receive products from China or other countries.<br /><br />In summary, my biggest disappointment with this unit is the attached reservoir that prevents me from drying this out easily.",1

It is also black, and I have light gray hair so for me a neutral scalp color would be better.

I began by backing up my QuickBooks desktop Pro 2018, and then began the installation process. It went smoothly and quickly and didn't take very long. I used the express installation which was recommended, and the whole thing was very easily done, retaining all of my previous settings and information.<br /><br />The part that was awful was that I have an existing payroll subscription and had to call into tech-support to upgrade that portion of things. Luckily I was aware of this so when simply entering the information into QuickBooks didn't work, I knew that I was in for a phone call. About 45 minutes later of being on hold and trying to be up sold on QuickBooks online by an Indian tech-support person (hey guys, I just got desktop Pro 2019 upgraded, please don't sell me on QuickBooks online), I was good to go.<br /><br />I think it's absolutely offensive that after you've purchased a software product like this they make you call in as a matter of course to activate. Anybody using this product is either being paid by the hour or runs a business and does not have that kind of spare time to sit around wasting on a process that should be 30 seconds of data entry.<br /><br />I have multiple employees and so end up paying an additional 4 to 8 dollars per month for the subscription to add additional employees. It's another two dollars a month per employee after the first one. Also, be aware that the setting is set to subscribe you to an annual payroll subscription, which if done through QuickBooks will cost you about $420. Purchasing the new upgrade of desktop Pro 2019 with the payroll for a year costs less than that, so being automatically billed such a high amount for just the payroll is offensive and ridiculous.<br /><br />I would really like QuickBooks as a company to reconsider how they deal with their payroll subscriptions and activation of payroll that has already been purchased, because this is a huge problem that is been garnering them poor reviews and lots of bad press for some time. I personally have considered many times changing to a more congenial company just to avoid this particular dance every single year. Do I pay $420 to avoid being on the phone for 45 minutes with somebody from India who act like I've done something terribly wrong by purchasing my payroll upgrade on Amazon along with the software upgrade? Or do I do as I have done most years and purchase the yearly upgrade that comes with the enhanced payroll.<br /><br />As an FYI, the enhanced payroll really does make it very easy to run your quarterly reports and do your e-filing. I did it myself for many years, but now hand the file back and forth to my bookkeeper via email as a portable file.",1

I find it nice and calming but I haven’t seen any difference in my skin per say. It is a nice massage tool that helps with circulation but I haven’t really noticed any difference using it.

The cat eye effect is very pretty and I love the fact that they reflect duo chrome with the perfect amount of sparkle. I had to play around with them a few times to get it right. First of all MAKE SURE TO BUY  A MAGNET as these polishes don't provide one. Second of all you will need to apply a black or dark base for the effect to show. If applied to the bare nail it won't work because the polish by itself is super sheer. After I applied the polish I placed the magnet above it for about 15 seconds....this is a very important step since this is NOT GEL it does disperse fast. All in all I had a really great experience and can't wait to show off my mani!,1

It's softer than the standard but firmer than the Ultra Soft.<br /><br />On the downside, it does not fit as well as the authentic Oral-B brushes. It's a little bit loose, which causes it to be noisier in operation than an authentic brush. It still works fine and stays on firm enough so there's no danger of it coming off in use, but there's enough play in the fit that it's more buzzy than an authentic.<br /><br />Even with the fit issue, this is a decent alternative to the Oral-B brand brushes and a solid 4-star brush.",1

I used (carefully!) one of these small razors to try shaving just a small area of my face and it really did remove all the peach fuzz.  I can't say that they are any better than a ladies electric facial shaver I've been using, but these would be a lot easier to carry in my purse just in case I needed to use one.

Not to be deterred, I opened the box, pulled one of the razors from the box, removed the plastic cover and tried it.  If you look closely at the one picture, you will see what appears to be a drop of blood - it is.  That is why I described this as a straight razor with a guard in quotes.  Make NO mistake, these are SHARP.  Use them delicately and only on smooth skin.  If you have a blemish, a mole or anything just slightly raised on your skin, it will be cut off.  You will bleed.

They are very similar in style to all the other dermaplaning razors out there, but they are longer than any I have used. The blade is just a hair under 2"". Pun intended. One of the popular blades among beauty conscious people (pictured) is around 1.5"". Many are 1"" or less. SO, keep this in mind for where you want to use this and if you are comfortable with that length of blade. Otherwise it is all very similar.<br /><br />I like that this 5 pack is contained within a box. Many are on a flat piece of cardboard with molded plastic around them. Makes it too easy to lose one, misplace one.. they just fall out of package when opened. This box will nicely store the remainder. I won't lose these among my other beauty goodies.<br /><br />I have no idea what it says on the box. The sticker on the box says Made in China. The box says, Made in Japan. I can't read anything else.<br /><br />Handle is short- I think adds to precision of use. The longer blade makes it harder to get the eyebrow area. For that, I would go with a smaller, angled razor. For larger areas of face (or other body areas), this large blade is nice. As with any blade, BE CAREFUL. And don't over use it- a dull blade can be as dangerous and damaging as a sharp blade.<br /><br />The blade is indeed sharp. I usually use a regular razor (like for shaving legs) to shave my face. I have pale skin and dark hair, so I have always preferred to just shave off my hair. No, it doesn't grow back thicker or darker. But it sure makes the face nice and smooth- great for make up looking good, for skin care setting in nicely, for exfoliation- for overall health of skin. A leg razor is fine, less likely to cut.. but a straight razor provides an extra close shave (if careful). I love these for taking care of upper lip area, and for eyebrow area.. but is taking some getting used to since it is a longer blade than others I use.",1

From my experience with different lamps, leave your nails in the curing lamp for the maximum time. This is quite handy and easy to use. Follow all instructions and you should get great results. Hint: when you go to start your  nails, put a coat of Elmer's glue around your skin around the nail and it will keep the gel, base and top coat from sticking to your skin.",1
AECJWYAOJ34RILHGK2CKU42UOVKA,B07RP9FXLW,4,2019-06-28 10:22:49.048,Works well- pretty design,"I love the look of this lamp. It almost looks like it came straight out of a salon from the 50s, but also manages to look very modern.  It's relatively small and doesn't take up too much space among my other bathroom appliances beneath the sink.  The plug isn't very long, maybe 4 feet, so wherever you do your nails you will need to be sitting near an outlet.<br /><br />My daughter has sensitive skin, and when she stuck her hand under the lamp she said it bothered her hands a little because of the heat.  I don't think the heat was too intense.  I have a fresh burn on my finger that didn't feel bothered by the light so I'm attributing that to her being younger and more sensitive to heat, but I do think it's something to be aware of.<br /><br />My fingernails weren't completely dry when I pulled them out, and I had to run them through twice as many cycles as the nail polish recommended, but honestly I think it was due more to the nail polish I used than it was a fault of the lamps (for reference, it was China Glaze brand Gelaze).  The nail polish was really super runny and had a watery consistency with very thin coverage.<br /><br />Two days later though (a record for two people who are hard on their nails) my daughter and I both have zero chips in our polish.  I'm pretty happy to have received this and think it would make a great gift or be a good purchase for those who want to save a little money from getting a professional manicure.<br /><br />Just one last note: I had to go to a beauty supply store to find a gel polish that needed a lamp.  It seems like many gels these days advertise no lamp needed.  Personally I feel like those aren't any better than regular polish, but it's something to consider.",1

AGV5RMN6RNZS4SMIMAT2NRDRKFPA,B07R3BMYBG,3,2019-07-04 18:04:44.540,Not for me,"I'v tried several types of products to remove facial hair: coil groomer, tweezers, electric face trimmer, and these. The coil groomer was the most difficult to use. No matter how much I twisted it, I could only get a hair or two after a few tries. Tweezing was faster and more effective. The electric face trimmer was designed for removing all facial hair, including nose and ear hair, so the cutting tip was very small and the cutting mechanism was gentle on delicate skin. It was great at removing the peach fuzz on my cheeks; I just needed to make several swipes to get my whole cheek.<br /><br />These shavers are well made. Unfortunately, the instructions were all written in either Japanese or Chinese. I figured they looked self explanatory, so I didn't look up videos on how to use them. The cutting tip is long, which should make shaving go faster as it can cover a larger area. However, the larger blade also means that it is more difficult to reach certain areas. I have a lot of small moles on my face, so I made sure to be extra careful while using them. Despite this, I managed to nick myself a few times. What's ironic is that the nicks weren't on any moles.<br /><br />I think my skin is just too delicate and uneven to use these shavers.",0

This set contains a beautiful rose pink quarter roller with two tiny bottles containing quartz crystals. I love the bottles but the downside is absolutely no instructions are given as how to use them. If you add essential oils, you usually need a carrier oil (like coconut) because they are not good for your skin if applied directly. I'm not sure how the crystals would mitiate this or not, as they're just little rocks. As a result, I'm not sure how to use these.<br /><br />The roller itself, however, is of good quality and I've been using it frequently.

Lol, I got toothpaste everywhere and learned this the hard way. Functionally, the vibrations are powerful by default, so if you are sensitive like me, turn it down. I’ve used it 4 times now and the first time it was strange, but now I am use to it. There are 5 different pulsating settings (see video). The plus and minus icons allow for easy and quick adjustment of how hard/soft - fast/slow the vibrating brush-head will pulsate. The bristles on the brush attachment is firm, but soft on gums; so there is some bend to the bristles and was comfortable for me. It sits on a charger to power it up via usb cord that plugs into standard charger plug. The case is beyond awesome. I travel for conferences and this stores the brush and charger with the brush head in a beautiful pink bottom and clear top hard case. Easy to pack and go. My teeth feels very clean after using this electronic toothbrush. For my set, I have 5 extra brush head attachments for exchanging after wearing out. This set looks exactly like advertised. I love the pink design. It is long and slender with sliver trim. My video will show the different settings and I hope you can hear the slight vibration changes because you could easily tell from the sound of the pulse by which setting it is on through a couple of uses. My favorite thing about it is that the charger is small and doesn’t take up any room on the sink countertop. The travel case is sturdy. The quality of this brush is so great that I don’t want to ever go back to a standard manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you need a travel brush that is electronic! Update: A week later and I still love it! Everything works very well!!",1

In total it includes 6 brush heads (in the photo, one was still in the box), a charger, a case to hold the toothbrush and two brush heads for traveling, and the toothbrush itself with 5 distinct modes. Really you can think of it as having 15 modes because each mode can be on high, medium, or low intensity. The instruction manual describes each of the modes - they vary in rhythm and power. I used one of the weaker settings as the manual suggested because this is my first time using an electric toothbrush, which was the perfect amount of power for me! Have to mention that when this touches your lips by accident it tickles like I have never been tickled before, but I think that is to be expected from any electric toothbrush and just takes some getting used to.

They are so close to being the same size to fit, but the post on this toothbrush is too big for my replacement Phillips heads to fit.

It also makes it much easier to use a light amount.  Considering the light amount you use, the size of this bottle is going to last FOREVER.  This really makes me more likely to use it daily vs just when going out.  It really does make a nice smooth surface to apply makeup to and reduces the powdering or blotchy look of your makeup.<br /><br />Do not let “moisturizing” fool you though, this isn’t like a bb cream, you do still need a separate moisturizer.  Also keep in mind it is “minimizing”, it doesn’t make your pores magically and completely disappear, especially if you have any enlarged pores.  It works great on my chin and forehead to reduce pores but I have some enlarged pores on my nose that it doesn’t touch.<br /><br />I’ve used other primers that work slightly better but at a MUCH higher cost so I save them for going out vs every day.  I think this makes a good every day primer.  And since I still use a separate moisturizer that has spf I don’t have to worry about this not having it.  Between the affordable cost and the refreshing feel and scent this has definitely converted me to a daily primer user.",1

I really love all the settings this one has. This has two buttons that control the temperature up or down and it has a little window to show what the current temp is. The maximum temperature is 350 and it reaches that rather quickly. It has a switch that controls the speed of the twirl low or fast. Then there is a button to control the direction you want to curl your hair left or right and it has a home button to return the iron to the correct home position. This has a flipper that is about an inch to start your twirl but it leaves crease marks in your hair that cannot be corrected unless you re-wet it and start all over. It really needed a heat resistant glove because no matter how skilled you are at this you are going to try and wrap your hair with your hand so it is a high probability of user error which will probably result in a burn. This is a really nice gray and white. I do like this curling iron it just has a few hiccups.,0

They're stretchy and I haven't had any break which is awesome. I do think the price is a little steep, especially since some hair ties are really cute but others in my opinion are kinda corny and wouldnt be my first choice.

After spraying, I gently rubbed it more evenly on my face. It dries instantly and wow, my face felt like velvet. If anyone knows about aging skin- your make-up shows the fine lines and wrinkles more exaggerated. This primer spray somehow smooths your skin more, leaving it like a smooth slate for make-up.

It takes some practice to get it right, but it's worth it!","It's easy to put this mascara on without it clumping or making a mess.  When I first started using it, I put on two coats which definitely defined and darkened my lashes.  I could also see where it sometimes added fibers, but they were not consistent and only attached to a few of my lashes.  I was not particularly impressed.  However, after reading the ""Customer Questions and Answers,"" I saw one that said I needed to ""swirl the wand in the mascara before removing it from the bottle"" and ""use a zig-zag technique by moving the wand back and forth as you drag the wand upward.""  When I followed this advice, it looked WAY, WAY different than my natural lashes (see photo 1) or my lashes using two coats of another quality name-brand mascara (see photo 2).  In fact, I got a DRAMATICALLY different look to my eyelashes, which definitely look longer and fuller (see photo 3).  It loads a lot of mascara on the brush using this method (see photo 4).<br /><br />I'm also happy that on those occasional nights when I'm too tired to worry about taking the mascara off before I go to bed, I get up with it still looking good and no fibers in my eyes.  I love that it wears well and washes off easily without leaving any dark smudges under my eyes.<br /><br />Overall, I think using this mascara takes some practice but the end results are worth it if you do it right!",1

After a few seconds, just let go of the clamp and you have a curl! Brush it through and you'll get the results in the photo. There really wasn't any kind of kink in the end of my hair either as sometimes happens with clamps (as long as you don't rotate the barrel the wrong way from how you clamped it). One nice thing is that there’s a “home” button for when you rotate the barrel too far from where your thumb is to unclamp the strand - you can see it in the video where it kind of rotates back real quick to line up the clamp release with my thumb. All in all it was really quick, less than 15 minutes to figure the thing out and curl my full head of hair!",1

AF6QHJSY6N5MMHTC5L26QOTX6K3Q,B07GDQPG12,3,2019-07-28 22:18:31.635,Nice but could be made better,"This roller does indeed turn applying skin care products into a spa experience. Pop this baby in the fridge on hot summer days as a way to take your skin from tired to taut. Warm it up to help your skin absorb products more easily. It washes clean and doesn't absorb any of the products. The trouble comes from how it's put together. The metal caps that hold the rollers on each end of the wand/handle come off too easily. They aren't glued or crimped on, nor are the little metal caps snug fitting. Both ends where off when my roller arrived so I actually thought I had to assemble everything prior to each use. If I hold the roller up to where it's straight up and down, the roller that is facing the floor slides right off the handle. In a way this isn't a completely horrible thing since being able to disassemble the roller works better for travel.  Just please be careful when opening your storage bag and pulling out the roller in case yours is the same way. If it were to fall onto a hard enough surface from a high enough height, the rollers could crack or shatter.<br /><br />Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I do enjoy using this roller and not only for applying skincare products. Sticking the roller in the freezer for 20 minutes then using it on my face and neck when I am suffering from a migraine is a godsend. I recommend having two so that you can use one to battle your headache while the other one cools down. The rollers hold cold (or heat) for several minutes, and can be wonderful tools to help relieve pain from stuffed up sinuses as well as headaches. The little gua sha tool that is included is also wonderful for more than applying skin care products. Chilling the gua sha before use can help treat puffy eyes, headaches, small bruises, mosquito bites, foot massages, and so on. Both this and the roller are completely smooth  - no rough edges or bumps.<br /><br />Also included are a black velvet bag for storage, a handy booklet showing how to use both the roller and gua sha, and a hand written note thanking me for my purchase which is a really sweet gesture. All-in-all the tools are nice products, but for the price you'd think the manufacturers could afford glue to keep the rollers on the handle.",0

And runs by USB power so its very low wattage.<br />My mother is diabetic and has to be very careful about the shape of her toenails.  Its very important to avoid infection.  Regular clippers are hard to position correctly sometimes.  And there is a risk of 'over cutting' the nail and causing issues that way.<br />With these you are shaping the nail slowly so you can control it a whole lot better.  Less chances of clipper accidents.<br />**I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV.  Its just my opinion that these are a good choice for diabetics.<br />I was given these as a vine promotion for the review.  But that aside I like it and see it as a durable useful tool.

AHBDPVXHGNIRMIGLCRCABCOLFJTA,B07T3Z58HL,5,2019-08-02 19:47:10.507,Quite happy with this! A great find.,"I had some reservations... I’ve seen the round wood ones around, but never made the leap. I was afraid the ceramic would make this too heavy and bulky, but it does not. It’s quite lightweight and because it’s vertical, saves some space. It comes with extensive directions - a nice change - but is really very easy to use and set up. It’s very hot and humid where I live, so I was also worried that adding more humidity to the air would be a bad thing, however, the air that comes out is quite cool, which seems to cool down the area around it (and by “it”, I mean me). I found it very comfortable.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how I felt about the colored lights option, but I love it! You can choose red, or a brighter red, and also green and a soft lavender blue with their corresponding brighter shades. You can choose to have your color, or opt to have the unit cycle through them all. It’s quite restful. You can, of course, just use the white light. You can set the steam for a continuous output or intermittent.<br /><br />The until must be cleaned after 10 hours of use. It doesn’t hold a great deal of water, so I was wondering if that was going to be inconvenient. I ran it for two continuous hours and I could tell that filling the tank twice would be about 10 hours. So THAT’S easy to keep track of!<br /><br />All in all, I couldn’t be happier with this unit! It checks all the boxes and I can enjoy my essential oils in an peaceful, comforting environment. Highly recommended!!",1

AEKMOOO4KWY3MG4M2CXWFQQ7Q5CA,B07T3Z58HL,4,2019-08-04 10:50:54.199,A fair diffuser,"I've been diffusing essential oils for almost 30 years, ever since I purchased my first diffuser from Whole Foods back in the 1980s.  This diffuser is not representative of the latest generation of diffusers, but it fits nicely within the last generation.  The latest generation of diffusers are not waterless, cordless (rechargeable) and portable.  I have both types of diffusers in my home and much prefer the latest gen.<br /><br />This is a nice diffuser but is slightly more expensive than it should be, even with the ceramic appointments.  Like all water diffusers you put water in the chamber with a few drops of oil and let it go.  The light is nice but doesn't serve much purpose other than to remind you that the unit is on when you cannot see the cold steam.  I'm not a fan of the whole thing being lit because it does cause me to take a second look if my eyes slightly open while I'm sleeping.  I prefer a thin band of light. Of course on this unit you can turn the light off.<br /><br />It doesn't come with any oil which is actually good.  I find that when an oil is included in with a diffuser it's often the cheapest brand around and smells awful.  It might be enough to turn a newbie off of diffusing if they don't know that high quality oils exist.  I recommend Plant Therapy.<br /><br />I don't buy into the claim that this can be used as a humidifier because the output is just not strong enough.  After shut-off there is always water still left in the chamber.  This is not a good thing because if you want to change oils, you have to diffuse water with vinegar for a couple of run-throughs and then wipe down the inside. Of course there is nothing wrong with left over oil if you don't mind a blend, but sometimes I want one pure smell for a specific purpose.",1

Firstly, it comes with numerous accessories- a fluffy brush for removing dust from the nail and work area, a set of to separaters for painting, a nail board, and the drill bits themselves.  The entire set is nicely packaged and comes nestled in a velvety foam materials.  The bits are held in their own clear container within the box.  The set comes with a detachable adapter that plugs into the end of the drill and then into the wall outlet.  The drill itself is small enough to handle pretty easily, although I can see where it would be difficult for someone with smaller hands than myself (I have large hands.)  Inserting and removing the bits can be a challenge.  The mechanism isn't well made so I have to fight with it.  The power cord is much too short and I had to use an extension cord to give myself some wiggle room away from the wall outlet.  Some of the bits' textures do a better job than the others, while some don't do anything at all.  The over all look and feel of the set isn't worth the price, in my opinion.

My hair loses curl within an hour of me fixing it.  I've tried other rotating curling irons and haven't had much success with them, so I didn't have very high expectations for this beach waver.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of it, I found it to be pretty easy to use.  It features buttons that allow you to chooses which direction you would like to curl each section of hair, and a Home button that after each use, and after the previous section of hair is no longer attached, allows the barrel to return to a neutral starting point.  I ran into an issue the first few times I used it, which was accidentally hitting the home button while my hair was still around the barrel.  This caused the hair to get very tight and the barrel to press up against the scalp.  This is very easy to do and I definitely think a design change should take place to correct this issue.  The barrel is long enough for my medium-long hair and I can see it needing to be used more than once up and down the length of long hair.  The curling iron gets up to 410 degrees max, which works pretty well on my thick hair.  I've tried fixing my hair in different ways after using it, to see which method holds the curls longer.  I still have an issue with my hair losing the curls a bit to quickly but it's remedied by using styling products before and after curling it.  To be honest, I think this beach waver is very overpriced.  Maybe the results would be better for someone with thinner hair but I don't think I'd pay more than $50 for this curling iron.  Nice results, but the design flaws make this a product I won't reach for that often.",1

I did use more than the recommended amount, which I found to be a bit on the low side since the size of the mist is so small the amount of product that you get out on a single spray is minimum. After I applied, I watched in the mirror as it dried, and the effects were amazing. My shine do go away and I could literally see my pore getting smaller. I could see myself using this alone on a hot summer day without makeup because the finish it gave was just that great. My makeup also went on very easy and smooth and felt as if it was gliding across my face and not going into every wrinkle and groove.

I really liked the idea of a brush that blow dries while styling your hair at the same time. I have used this airbrush several times and always come up very frustrated. For starters, your hair needs to be at least 75% dry for this to even work. That to me defeats part of the purpose of it. Then while I try and give my hair volume by rotating the brush at the roots my hair gets all twisted and pulled inside the brush. I am thinking this may because my hair is just long enough to wrap around the barrel. After spending at least 20 minutes trying to figure out how to not have my hair get tied around the brush and pulled out I do think there is my volume at the roots. The roller also stops working for no apparent reason.  Is it worth the work? To me no. I will stick to the tried and true blow dryer with a manual brush.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",0

When applied to the face, it immediately begins to blend with the color of the skin right before your eyes.  It has somewhat of a weird smell if you put your nose up to the bottle.  I didn't notice it once I applied or throughout the day.  This makeup does not come off onto your clothes like regular foundation.  It comes off the same way it went on.  When applying it, it goes on more like moisturizer then makeup.  Its got SPF in it so it takes an extra swipe or two to get it to completely blend in but when it does its so lightweight, you don't even notice its there. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  Oh and you don't get that later in the day shiney look with this makeup.  It really is pretty cool stuff!",1

But with or without this primer my results are about the same. I get shiny within just a couple of hours. I did not notice much result from it at all.

This does seem to help a bit, I notice in particular that my cheek color stays on much better. When I don't use a primer, it's like my skin drinks it up within just a few hours. So it definitely helps with that.<br /><br />I really don't see any change in the texture of my skin when I use it, no minimizing of lines or pores or anything like that. I was kind of hoping a nice little mist of vitamins might help (& feel good) even when I'm not wearing makeup, but to be honest it doesn't really feel much different. I tried for a few days & then I kept forgetting all about it - that's how dramatic the difference...wasn't. I'll still keep using it under makeup for performances, when I really need that stuff to stay put, but I probably won't rush to buy it again after I run out.",0

This brush styler is extremely thick and awkward to hold in my opinion. It has a lot of weight and bulk to manipulate while you are styling your hair.  The buttons are at a weird position making it hard to change the heat levels unless you stop what you are doing and actually move your hand to look at the buttons.  I thought it felt a lot hotter than my hair dryer with less options to reduce the heat.  I liked it better without the brush rotating but felt like it actually took a lot longer to dry with this styler than my blowdryer.  I received a compliment that my hair had more body today but I felt like it was more frizzy than usual.  I like my hair better when I flat-iron it and today I just felt like I had poofy 90's Jennifer Aniston hair.  I'm just not thrilled with this device.,0
AGN5R4K2X2CIV3WBSWHNDRUWTWQA,B07TVBW1HT,5,2019-08-31 17:06:06.731,Great water pressure,This hose head is really made well.  It’s solid metal and has a nice heavy duty feel to it.  I was a little confused at first because it comes with that smaller screw in attachment already screwed into the base.  I almost though I got something that wasn’t for a garden hose but you just need to unscrew it an take that piece out if your using with a standard garden house.<br /><br />The water stream comes out very strong and it is adjustable by turning the head.  It does have the little metal clip so you can lock it and not have to keep holding the handle down.  What I really like though is the water pressure aspect.  I’ve been using those expandable garden hoses and they tend to not give you much pressure.  This head really gives you the extra pressure and makes it so I can reach the further spots of the yard.  I’m very impressed with this.  All around it’s a well made product.,1

Strong!!! As soon as I tore open the packet ... bam. That smell hit me.<br /><br />The actual pads come out of the packet folded in half, have a pinkish color & they seem to be made out of felt or a felt like fabric.<br /><br />I decided to use one to take off my bright Red toenail polish. The first 2 nails came clean but then I started to notice that the remover pad was smearing the polish all over my toes & leaving finger nail polish color on my fingers.<br /><br />Overall, the pads do work but you're probably going to have to use at least 2 at a time. That means only 5 nail polish removals per box & for the price listed, I find them highly overpriced.<br /><br />Excuse my swollen foot picture, I'm trying to show how using just 1 nail polish remover pad left my toenail/toe area with a pinkish red hue.",0

There aren't any instructions other than to clear the tube in case it gets stuck. It says it's a continuous spray and through a brief trial and error I discovered you pump the handle to prime the spraying mechanism and that makes it basically a continuous spray. The pump is really easy to operate, you can easily squeeze it with one finger. When you put the top back on you have to push it down and then it's just like a half or quarter turn to keep it on. One of the questions was would I take it when I travel and it's a little too bulky to bring it with on all trips. If I think I would need it or have tons of room in my suitcase maybe.",1

With a regular spray bottle, I always end up getting a lot of water on the floor when spraying my hair, then have a problem cleaning up the floor after cutting my hair as my hair is stuck to the wet floor.<br /><br />This bottle has solved my problem.

The bottle is easy to hold, is a great weight and is balanced well. The trigger is easy to pull.<br /><br />This bottle is perfect to use for homemade wrinkle reducer for clothing as well. I just mix one cup of water and a tablespoon of fabric softener, shake well, then spray on fabric while pulling down on the fabric. The micro-fine mist dispenses a perfect light spray, so the fabric dries quickly.<br /><br />This bottle is very easy to clean so I can use it for several things, but I'd like to get more so I can stop switching the contents out.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.",1

AGSTQ3JDGW2TZB5XKBF7PD2DJOKQ,B07PHDQZ6K,5,2019-09-08 19:32:57.585,This little bugger works!,"I'll be honest.  I was rather skeptical when I received this.  It looks sleek and pretty but does it actually work?  My answer to that question is a resounding YES.  You wouldn't think a little buzzing device could make your skincare products do their best job but boy, oh, boy does it ever.  The three settings are for Cleansing (also used for extractions), Moisturizing, and Lifting.  Each setting causes the device to vibrate at different speeds and achieve different goals.  Using it is fairly easy.  Hold the button until you hear it turn on and then give the button a quick press to choose between functions.  There are lights above each mode and they will light up when you are on said mode.  The included instructions are very easy to follow and explain how to use it in a simple way.  It's all about keeping very light pressure, while holding the side bars, which add the effective charge to the device, allowing the ionization process to take place.  I have seen a difference in my skin already and I have only used it in each mode 3-4 times.  It could be easy to overdo it after seeing the results you do, but the instructions specifically advice you on how often each function should be used so the skin isn't having reverse effects from what you want it to.  I think the price for this item is fantastic!  I have a reduction in blackheads, my skin seems to glow after use, and my products are sinking into my skin better and faster.  This one for the win!",1
AHA6NYC6QHOU7G37PNF5EBIOUBWQ,B07S9GZZ6H,5,2019-09-08 21:25:41.555,easy to use and effective,i love the convenience and ease of use. just dip your finger in the hole and it erases the polish like it never happened. it is potent stuff. it's basically just remover with a foam soaked inside with a bunch of incisions that you can insert your nails in. no complaints except that you will taste the fume (bitter) when you first open it. just keep it away from nose.,1

Using ordinary nail polish didn't have that effect.<br /><br />Previously:<br />These are convenient for travel but I found that using one pad just isn't enough to remove the nail polish from both hands, especially if you have glitter or gel. When you rip open the packet, the cloth is heavily saturated with nail remover and when you unfold it it's about the size of one of those wet naps you get when you eat greasy food. I draped the cloth over both hands and pressed my nails against it, but though I used every inch of the cloth and squeezed out as much product as I could, I still had leftover polish on the edges of my fingers. Not wanting to waste a whole other cloth to finish the job, I blotted the remainder using a cotton ball and my usual polish remover.<br /><br />Overall, it's strong and will remove most of your polish, but the cost of this product is higher than if you stocked up on a few bottles of nail polish remover and used cotton balls. But if you're traveling, it would definitely be  more convenient and I suppose that's what you're be paying for. But be prepared to use 2 cloths at a time to get it all off, which adds up to only 5 uses.",0

It is light but feels like it soaks in really well. I absolutely love the lemon scent.  It has a saltiness to it that makes it a very unique but nice scent.  The light weight texture combined with the scent make this a great product.  My only complaint is that once the lid is turned to open, it can be hard to press down on the top to get some of the lotion out.  The bottle is slippery once I have lotion on my hands and so sometimes it is hard to keep open so a minor design flaw but the product is great and I really think it works well on my more mature skin.",1

Perfect for you....,"Thoughts:<br />If you have curly hair you inevitably come acrossed frizzy hair or lax curls after long day or bed Head. Using this fine most spray allows one to refresh curly, tame frizzes. Although I don't iron, I can understand how it could be useful in that activity too. It mists so fine without soaking. The trigger is long pull, but simple and easy to squeeze even with someone with arthritis. Love this product, fantastic addition to my hair styling products!!<br /><br />Details:<br />Volume: 160ml. Size: 7.8 × 2.1in (198 × 53mm). Weight: 3.4oz (99g) Material: PET (Polyethylene terephthalate). Spray duration: 1.2 seconds per compression or even lasts for 5 senconds if pressing it longer.. Operation: No pumping required, just press trigger and get a nice steady stream spray. Ideal for hair styling, taming bed head in the morning, waking up and refreshing curls and waves, misting house plants, house cleaning, preparing clothes for ironing, etc. With 0.3mm diameter spray nozzle, this water spray bottle can deliver super-fine water mist, providing just the right amount of moisture without over-wetting your hair.",1

As they claimed I’ve been putting this moisturizer day and night time. It’s a bit early to tell if my fine lines and wrinkles are reduced. However, my face was hydrated after use without having any skin issues. My husband is struggling with dry skin lately due to the weather. I recommend him to use this since this product is for men and women. He’s been liking this moisturizer. He said this has decent scents without being too overwhelming. My husband and I both like this moisturizer. I would recommend to people.",1
AE6TDCUOKCSCRL5ZHWKEL7QHOA3A,B07SRW6NVK,3,2019-09-11 14:26:25.513,"Light Cream, Good for Day Use","This light cream has a lovely, not-too-heavy scent, and smooths onto my skin quite easily.  There is no draggy feeling as with heavier creams.  And that is both a plus and a negative.  While I like this for daytime because it doesn't feel greasy, it does not feel hydrating enough for night time, at least not for my old skin.  I like that this product is made in the USA, and that it is cruelty free, although ""cruelty free"" claims need to be taken with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The pump bottle works well, and keeps air out of the product, but there is no over-cap or anything, so this is best left on the counter.  Putting it in a travel bag could cause a mess.<br /><br />Although I like this for a day cream, I can't find that it contains any sun protection, so if you are going to spend any time in the sun, you'll need a separate product.<br /><br />This seems a good product, but in my opinion, it is not outstanding, doesn't really differentiate itself from dozens of other products in all price ranges.",0

I went with this shade which is a bright red with orange tones. It just goes with everything I wear and surprisingly my hair color at the moment. I also like how versatile this is so I can dress up or down with this color. It is 100% vegan, made with plant based wax and other natural ingredients like candelilla wax, castor seed oil, shea butter, almond oil, grape seed oil, jojoba, and coconut oil. The lipstick feels very smooth when applying and it I didn’t need a liner. And I think I reapplied when I remembered to after 3 hours and held up fine without any chapping or colorless patches. This is cruelty-free too!",1

It is a lovely rose-gold color and has a sleek design.

There is also a power button, up/down temperature control, and a barrel lock to keep the clamp closed.<br /><br />I did find that this straightener heated up really quickly.  It did not, however, straighten my hair very efficiently.  I had to go over really small sections multiple times to achieve the desired results.  That cannot be good for your hair and it took forever!  My hair is very thick and on the coarse side so it may be much better suited to someone with finer hair.

It takes a bit for it to heat up and would take forever to actually dry wet hair. It works well on lightly damp hair.  It has a button that spins the barrel different direction and it’s quite easy to use, but the motor to turn the barrel isn’t very strong and it take a bit to get going.

AF6QHJSY6N5MMHTC5L26QOTX6K3Q,B07G23R7ZX,4,2019-09-30 13:49:54.778,Great set of gentle clippers,"This is an excellent set of clippers for more than just younger children. My nephew is on the spectrum and has trouble with various sensations and noise, so haircuts have always been an exercise in patience.<br /><br />Unlike other hair clippers, the sound level with these is lower and less irritating to him. The ceramic blades and guides are also more gentle on skin. He's been nicked before by barbers and stylists, and that has only added to this apprehension of getting his hair cut. The blades on this set of clippers isn't as sharp as what you'd find in a barbershop (probably because they are ceramic versus steel), so you do have to make a couple more passes to cut hair and to get a close shave on the neck, but that's okay because he doesn't fear being cut by these clippers.  The blade covers are also smoother without any edges from the plastic molds or those sharp little nodes from where plastic was injected into the molds or where the guides were snapped apart. It's almost as if they went through a sanding process. It's a little thing, but then again it's not, you know?<br /><br />Battery life is pretty good as well. One full charge is more than enough to get through a haircut even if the person has thick hair.",1

I'm not sure how... but my hair (and my daughters) seems to come from the wand so much shinier. It has an adjustable temperature setting, it does lock closed. It even comes with a bag to keep it in and a glove to wear while you are using it... which is where I have my problem. The way it opens leaves my hand too close to the heat which results in easily getting burned. Which isn't a problem if you wear the glove... but being honest, I'm not going to use a heat shield glove every day to do my hair. I only use one of these **sometimes** when I am using a curling wand. So for me that is a huge con. It also comes with two hair clips to help separate the sections of your hair. For the price... Its a great wand. You will get used to where you need to hold your hand.",1

The first was great, but I find that the fragrance is too much for me with this Honey one. These products do contain ""parfum"" as an added ingredient, but it is last on the list. I have included a picture of the ingredients as I do not see the list anywhere else. My other salt scrub by this company-bloodorange, and that scent is wonderful and fresh, in bottle, in shower, and on skin after (very light). This one is just heavy, rather perfume like. I have noticed some shea containing products have that, but the other one that I do like has shea as well but isn't cloying. So I don't know. I'm afraid it might trigger a headache for me. I may have to have someone else in the household finish it off. Love the other one I mentioned, though!<br /><br />As for how it works- no problem. A thick frosting like creamy texture with a hint of grit. It does a nice job cleaning, polishing, and leaving the skin feel smooth and moisturized. It is a gentle scrub- very gentle. Definitely softens skin. I scoop out a generous 1/8-1/4 cup amount to use on my body. With that amount, I expect several uses from this squat container. I particularly like this one for my legs and feet as they are the most neglected in terms of skin care.<br /><br />I really do like Natural Soultion salt scrubs, and it appears that there are 4 kinds. This one based solely on the fragrance is a miss for me, but another one happened to be a hit for me, which I will continue to use as needed.<br /><br />EDIT: While a whiff from the container is too strong for me, the actual aroma in the shower continues to be pretty tame. It dawned on me to smell my skin after showering (something I didn't do with prior showers prior to initial review), and my skin doesn't have that strong smell that I note from the container. It smells pleasant and light, and I wanted to come back to say so.SO I just wanted to say that I haven't had a headache, and I don't actually smell like the scent from the container- I was concerned I would have that perfume smell. It isn't there, thankfully.<br /><br />I'd boost it to a 5 rating, but the product descriptions says, ""No Artificial Fragrances Or Perfumes"", and ""parfum"" is on ingredient list- and doesn't say where that is derived from.",1

Expect to get wet the first few times, if not more. The learning curve and mess is worth it -- my mouth generally feels cleaner after using one -- but I don’t love this particular model.<br /><br />I wanted a water flosser that wouldn’t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter. This one is a sort of all-in-one, with the reservoir built into the handle, but I kept getting water bubbles in the tank/tip, which made flossing take a lot longer.<br /><br />There’s only 3 speeds: low, medium, and high. The low is quite low. And because of where the speed switch button is, it’s really easy to accidentally switch speeds while using the flosser.<br /><br />The flosser charges via USB, but with a proprietary end (not A or C or anything like that).",0

Dermatologists said to take Vitamin C 2 for weeks before use, and avoid sunlight; avoid makeup; your skin may peel afterward. So, I was afraid to try it out.  It turns out, that using this is not painful at all.  But when used on my forehead, it looks like it has more pores.  So, I decided to start taking vitamins, and planned out when to try this out, but I avoided trying it out before times when I planned to expose it to sunlight, along with one week before my (wife’s) period.<br /><br />Finally, I had the right time to try it out, and it had no obvious side effects...no pain, no skin flushing, no damage, no problems with sunlight or wearing makeup.  Because this is a device made for home use, it is much more mild than professional devices.  You may be able to use this every other day.<br /><br />The device is light weight, and rechargeable, but comes with batteries, so you don’t have to charge before use; this makes it easy to bring on travel.  I wish I had tried it much earlier.<br /><br />The head is supposed to be replaced every three months at a current cost of $35.  You are supposed to use a new cleaning pad before every use, and it came with 5 pads; the replacement skin prep pads are $35 for 30 pads which will last you two months, using it two to three times a week, which is what the manufacturer recommends.  The minimum monthly cost of supplies is about $38 per month.  You also need to have isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol to use with the provided spray bottle to sanitize the micro-needling head.<br /><br />I would recommend using sun screen after use, to protect your skin.<br /><br />After the first few uses, I haven’t seen much effect, but my husband thinks my face’s skin looks better.",1

When you see wigs on here for such a good deal it sometimes seems too good to be true. I am completely in love with this wig! I am attaching a picture and a short video. The picture is after I cut the lace, put on a wig cap to cover my half black hair, used a small amount of hair glue and then blended in with my foundation. The video is before I finsihed cutting the lace and did all of the above. First, I am a HUGE wig lover. I have a little over 40 now from so many different brands. This wig has fastly become a favorite. The quality is just crazy good for what you're paying. The hairline is beautiful and so easy to make look real.  But also I LOVE that it IS a free part and can be parted any way. I highly recommend it! You cannot beat the price. I am shocked with just how much I love it.",1

AFATNFWGYVVMEZWGDNLDUXRBRFLQ,B07TLMZL3T,5,2019-10-21 01:04:26.875,"Unique, Manual Squeeze-type Water Spray","This Fine Mist Clear Bottles, Segbeauty 5.4oz/160ml Continuous Plastic Spray Squirt Bottle is a unique style spray bottle that mists fairly well, without the typical pump action you need with regular manual spray bottles. This has a pressurized lever that provides a longer spray with one squeeze. The mist is fine, but not quite as fine as I was hoping- it's more granular than a steamer or vibration dispenser (like cool mist vaporizers), but this is manual, so I guess I'm complaining for no reason. For a hand pump spray, this is a very good (fine) spray overall.  They recommend that you not put anything but water in the device, and I'm guessing that may be due to it being easy to clog. So, if you do add some other products in the bottle, just be aware that it's not recommended.",1
AEQOG6H24VT6ATMKDKOY34SDUWWA,B00TK0VV68,5,2019-10-21 06:59:15.984,"Refreshing, Pleasant Scented 4-in1 Spray, benefits tired skin","This Embryolisse Eau de Beaute Rosamelis, Face Toner claims to be toner, cleanser, face mist and makeup fix all in one. I’m in love -I can’t stop spritzing! It makes my face look refreshed, bright and healthy even if I’m low on sleep or not looking too hot. It gives off a dewy appearance without looking oily. Excellent for dry or combo skin. Works great on hands too. Reminds me of a certain prestige brand that does the same thing at four times the price and half as well.<br /><br />The scent I would just describe as “fresh” and rose water is also detectable. Some may think this smells like “old cold cream,” but I say it’s just clean. The formula is very lightweight, like water mist.<br />It’s principal stated “active ingredients” are natural rose, orange blossom, cornflower and hamamelis flower waters. However, the ingredients also include witch hazel which makes an excellent face toner to clean out dirt from pores, glycerin that’s great for softening skin, and caster oil which is all around beneficial to skin (and enhances eyelash growth).<br /><br />As for a cleanser, it doesn’t remove medium-heavy makeup or waterproof mascara/liner very well but does clean out pores, blackheads and other nastyness. Also, if it can set applied makeup I think it could also make a good primer, though I haven’t tested this. I’ll update when I do.<br /><br />I definitely recommend trying Embryolisse toner, especially for dry skin or if your face needs a bit of a refreshing lift:). I can’t wait to try their other products. For almost 7oz this is a crazy value!<br /><br />I know I write long reviews, but if you’ve gotten this far I hope it was helpful for you in some way!",1

I usually get it at Target but I ran out and didn't feel like running out and was pleasantly surprised to find its even a bit cheaper on Amazon. I have fine, thin hair that is regularly color treated and sometimes heat styled. This is one of the products that keeps my hair healthy, despite the abuse it takes. When I wash my hair, I'll usually spray into damp hair from midlengths to ends so it doesn't weigh down my fine hair at the roots. It really nourishes my hair, keeping it soft, silky, shiny and healthy. I love the smell. At night, I mist my hair from roots to ends and leave in over night. It's a bit more expensive than other drugstore brands, but it's worth the extra money hands down",1

If you have real nail polish on it will fail to remove all but the sheeny top coat. The flimsy sponge does not provide enough pressure to remove a real manicure. The mouse is also too small to comfortably fit your hand, yet so wide that I spilled the nail polish remover inside (there are also no warnings on the container about the potential for spillage of the hazardous liquid). You can make your own by slitting a real sponge and sticking it in a bowl of acetone—it might actually do a better job than this.",0

I think I'll be buying several more of these so I'll never be without one! It's not shiny at all, very real looking. Is soft enough to feel like real hair. Will probably get matted at least slightly-moderately while wearing since ALL synthetic wigs do, so keep a pick in your purse and keep the unit conditioned with an appropriate wig spray or maybe a little silicone-based leave-in hair gloss, like Biosilk. Wig experts or YouTube videos can advise you on this best.<br /><br />Running my fingers through it right out of the package, to detangle and fluff it, I noticed there was absolutely no shedding. When combing it, there was no shedding. I was quite shocked. My other blonde wig from Kryssma sheds LIKE CRAZY and already has huge bald spots in it after brushing it only 5 or 6 times since purchase.<br /><br />I hope this wig won't be the same!!!

What I like most is that it doesn’t change the texture of my hair too much- none of that crunchy hair spray feel. It also has a nice scent, but it’s not too strong or overpowering.

You need to shake the bottle very well before using and be patient. You should file nails really good first before using. You may need to apply and scrape more than once with nail tool. Three times for really stubborn gel polish. It didn’t “burst” as advertised at least not on my nails but it bubbles up and lifts the polish making it much easier and less time consuming than traditional removal with acetone soaking. It’s not a horrible product but could be improved. Worth trying definitely I am glad that it makes removal faster.,0

This wig blew me away. The lace is so easy to disguise making it easier to look real. EVERY person that saw this wig on me thought it was my real hair. The quality is just PHENOMENAL! I have absolutely zero complaints or cons. I also love that the clips once attached help ensure that the wig doesn't slide at all. I also had no issues with the tightening straps coming out.

AFSPGS44EYOO4ZLJY4ZBIWNMTDOA,B07VGS56Z7,2,2019-12-10 23:40:33.628,Magnets are too weak!!,"Update: The top pair in the 234 was my favorite because it's the most natural looking but after 2 uses, one of the magnets fell off! This brand has quality issues. I decided to order many other brands of magnetic lashes (Newcally, LAMIX, Coolours) and I found that the magnets for the Yiwamica's lashes are considerably weaker. The other brands lashes would pop on and when pulled off would pull my skin a little. This brand's magnets do not do that. I have to press the eyelashes on and then corners would dislodge.  I thought it was due to the liner but no, it's the magnets! Between the magnets falling off completely and the weak magnets, I'm downgrading from 4 to 2 stars.<br /><br />As for the styles, I bought 3 sets from this listing: 230, 231, and 234. See my photo.<br /><br />The 234 is a set of 3 with a natural pair, a denser natural pair same length, and a longest natural pair. The length difference is probably 1mm, very hard to tell on the tray (I didn’t measure with ruler or anything) but you can tell in person when wearing them. I think only the first pair looks truly natural on me for everyday use because I have small Asian hooded eyes. The other two in the 234 tray are sort of natural but I would not use them for day time use.<br /><br />The 231 has 2 pairs that looked the same as the longest pair in the 234 set...again not natural enough for small eyes for day time use.<br /><br />The 230 has crisscrossed lashes where it is longer towards the outer corners and shorter towards the inner. These lashes are longer than those in the 231 and 234.<br /><br />I ended up returning 231 because it was a repeat of my least favorite pair in the 234 set.<br /><br />The 230 box had quality issues. One of the lash strands was super long on one of the lashes. The 230 set was also glued to the plastic holder instead of magnetized to strips on the tray like the other two sets. When I removed the lashes from the holder, the middle magnet fell off 2 of the lashes!<br /><br />I also got a eyeliner and 2 lash pair set from the same company. You can see in my photo. That eye liner turned out to be really bad so I returned that.<br /><br />Instead, I use the Aroama brand of magnetic liner also sold on Amazon (the one with over 1,000 reviews) with these lashes. The magnetics in these lashes are sorta big but since I have to draw the liner really thick for them to stay at all, it’s tough to even notice the magnets. The thick liner could also contribute to the lashes not looking as natural.<br /><br />I want to mention the magnet spacing is inconsistent across this brand. There are always 5 magnets but some are gapped evenly while others you get 2 magnets on each end and one in the middle with a huge gap on each side. The ends of the lashes do tend to detach from the eye easily for me as compared to the middle so the configuration with 2 magnets on the ends helps me. The spacing is purely up to your preference though. Pay attention to the product photos to see which magnet spacing you would get.",0

AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,B01MDTVZTZ,5,2019-12-13 11:22:19.676,Happiness all around.,"I tried curology but found it really harsh and didn't like the things I read about the company. I also didn't like that it's difficult to cancel and sometimes they just ship and say whoops sorry we already sent your new supply. I didn't have the time or patience to talk to some derm at curology and keep using myself as a guinea pig for their adjustments to the custom product. Anyway.... I've always found zinc helpful for my skin and niacinamide was in one of my curology products so I thought, hey for like 7 bucks, lets try The Ordinary. After using this morning and night for a few weeks, I'm like WHOA. I'm in my late 30's, have had hormonal breakouts for like 2 decades, recently stopped taking birth control and my chin/jawline has been going hormonally bananas. A few cystic and white heads galore. To be honest, nothing upsets me like a bad blemish. It makes me want to wear a mask like phantom of the opera. Super self conscious about it. Since using the Ordinary my chin area has calmed down, is a lot less irritated and red. The spots that seemed ready to go have diminished and lessened. This product is so simple, gentle yet quite effective. I was tired of all the acne things that dry the crap out of my face. I'll definitely keep this in my skincare forever. I love it, I love the price. I'd pay many more dollars to keep my skin clear but I am really super into the affordability. Happiness all around.",1

Which suprised me because it's filled with so many natural extracts like apple, lemon, carrot, aloe, grapefruit.  The directions suggest to put on before bed and slip cotton gloves on.

I'm not sure I'd call any of the microfiber towels rapid drying but they do pull out more moisture and create less frizz than a standard bath towel. I have super thick wavy (coughFrizzycough) hair that is just past my shoulders, and I had plenty of room to spare with this towel. It could easily work for even longer thicker hair.<br /><br />It wrapped so easily and really stayed put with the little elastic band in the back. My other is a standard towel so you have to twist and tuck and hope it stays. Not with these, super secure.

I have a plethora of creams and lotions but nothing works as well as this Quince hand lotion. Seriously, this is best hand cream I've ever used.<br /><br />The tube it good sized and the lotion is thick and creamy. It isn't greasy at all and absorbs into the skin. I does feel like it creates some kind of invisible glove barrier.  Since using it, my hands and cuticles have been softer and are healing.  The scent is very faint and a little odd. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but it does have a bit of a citrusy scent. It doesn't smell like quince fruit or carrot, but it's not a bad smell.<br /><br />C.O.

This is good on the one hand because it means you are less likely to get a headache by the end of the day from wearing one.  On the other hand, it is bad because it means they slip easily and don't hold hair in place very well.  The braided part is very pretty, but the black plastic of the headband is wider than the braid and so shows while you are wearing it and that looks rather weird.

I don't feel like I'm softly punching my face like I do with the others😂<br /><br />Very easy to clean, after use and have no weird smell or anything. I haven't used the puffs or brush yet but I'm going to attempt to use the puffs for powder or maybe even jelly products. The brush would probably work well for concealer or eyeshadow primer.

AFSPGS44EYOO4ZLJY4ZBIWNMTDOA,B07WCBS7N6,2,2019-12-29 07:42:56.774,Worst brand on the market,"I bought several brands of Magnetic Eyelashes and liners: Newcally, Yiwamica, CARETHYS, Coolours, and LAMIX. This one, CARATHYS was the worst. The eyelashes looked ""unkempt"" compared to the others and less natural because the fibers were double layered. The magnets on the back were such poor quality! They had weak magnetic power (compared to Newcally, LAMIX, and Coolours but same as Yiwamica) and they were glued on haphazardly. The spacing was uneven and they were all crooked. Yiwamica had magnet issues too, where the magnets were weak and some even fell off, but at least those lashes looked more natural. This brand was the worst.<br /><br />Two pros:<br />--Lashes fibers were thinner so looked more natural compared to the better quality brands and slightly less black<br />--The liner wasn't too bad. The consistency was actually pretty good, neither goopy nor too liquid, but the lash magnets are bad so not going to keep just for the liner!<br /><br />I would recommend Newcally for the best quality (but least natural). LAMIX and Coolours are also good choices.",0

Much to both of our surprises, it immediately began showing noticeable results on the first application.  When I say immediate, I mean right after we applied it our skin was much softer.  It wasn't that noticeable on the areas that were already healthy and soft.  The areas with cracked or excessively dry skin were immediately transformed into soft and moisturized skin.  It feels kind of tingly and minty going on also.<br />As far as the smell goes, its not noticeable unless you are trying to smell it which I probably wouldn't because what I can smell of it, I didn't really hate it but I definitely wasn't into it either.  It's a strange rusted orange color but does not leave stains on anything because it soaks into fabric/clothes just as regular lotion does.  The texture is a nice, thick one but considering, it soaks into the skin fairly fast.  Actually quicker then most other thick creams used for this purpose.",1

This lasts all day without smearing but it is super easy to wash off.  This is fairly inexpensive but I can tell it is not cheaply made. The applicator still looks squeaky clean.

I did try to remove my eye makeup with this balm and it was too greasy/thick and also stung my eyes, whereas my micellar water won't do that.<br /><br />The scent is a nice clean rose scent and I like the packaging, but I don't think I'll continue to use this.

I love the long chiseled pencil shape because it makes it easier to apply straight stokes of color to my very thin brows without looking drawn on or penciled in. However, it does skip a bit compared to my gel brow color that is applied with a brush. The sponge tip is great for softening the sharp line on the thicker area of my brow and i dab it with a bit of eye shadow to set it.  The color stays put and looks natural without leaning towards red. What more can you ask of a good brow pencil for brunettes? I overplucked my brows in my youth when pencil-thin brows were was the style (okay, I'm dating myself here) but this seems to apply quickly and easily and works well with super-thin brows without making me look like Groucho Marx. It works, it stays and looks great. Gals with thicker brows will reap the most benefit b using the mascara type brush for the most natural look and pigment distribution.",1

No smudging, flaking or clumping. Washes off with pure water and a bit of rubbing. Add some cleanser and it's effortless to remove. I can fall asleep with it on and no black eyes in the morning, just a few flakes from sleeping. It offers full volume and lengthens well. If you use a curler, you can get a very dramatic effect. It's buildable for more false eyelash looks without being clumpy. The wand is not straight. It is like a smiley face curve. But with a twist of the end, it curves into a ""u"" shape to get different angles. I would love this even with a normal straight brush.<br />The only complaint is that it dries out faster than others I've used, but is about the same as tarte waterproof in this regard.

I can see how this helps exponentially with your oral hygiene.  I honestly felt like a fool after seeing the results and realize this was what I was missing out on for many years.<br /><br />The items come in a box, you take one out, sterilize it and all you do is place over your tongue, apply pressure and pull down.

Don't do what I did but if you like a strong powerful massage with water temperatures that can go up to 118 degrees Fahrenheit, then this device is for you. The shower feature is excellent as well. I always hated bubbles in a foot massage spa. I found them useless. This does not have Bubbles and you will not miss them. Best foot spa ever made. Very durable easy to drain and the lid makes it extra quiet while it heats up. To heat it up make sure you have the massage rollers turned on. Will go from about 65° to a hundred and ten degrees in 20 minutes.",1

First, I am ok with the plastic handle. It is easy to grip and hold. And since it is plastic, you don’t have to worry about it looking faded after several washes (I do clean mine) like you do with the wooden ones. I’m even ok with the firm bristles (nylon and boar), because I have coarse hair and I’m not tender headed.  I like that it smooths the hair easily.  What I don’t like is the PRICE. I can’t believe they expect people to pay $49 for this brush. Yikes! And the sad thing is that it didn’t even come in pretty packaging. Just in a simple white box. So, while I am sure I will use this brush, I can’t get over the price. 2 stars",0

The tip is like a thick wax that gets covered with the serum but it’s difficult to use on the subtle lash line or eyes in general.

I like that the focus tends to be on creating healthy glowing skin through skin loving ingredients and maximizing hydration, which all skin types need. I find these Neogen Real Charcoal Pads to be super gentle, non irritating, lightly hydrating, skin brightening, deep cleaning of pores and other yucks on skin. Skin never ever tight, never irritated-- and I have non acne ROSACEA (flushing, telangiectasias/veins).<br /><br />I hadn't used the charcoal pads before, so I was excited to try them out. There are 60 pads in a tub with twist off lid. One side of the pad is quilted and you can clearly see the charcoal coloring. The other side is smooth. The pads are quite damp, and there is plenty of product on them to take care of face and neck, or to use as a targeted ""sheet mask"". Avoid eye area.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: AFTER washing, swipe the quilted side over skin. Then use smooth side to pick up traces of impurities. Pat in remaining essence.<br /><br />When I swipe the quilted side over my skin, I like to go slow with gentle pressure. I allow the product to sit for a moment before flipping the pad over to the smooth side (more white than gray) and wipe my face. One side applies the product, the other helps to lift up what is left behind- or brought to surface as it is meant to draw out impurities and wastes. I noticed that the pad was turning tan/brownish leading me to believe that these pads were indeed doing a good job of breaking down excess junk on my face (despite a good cleansing) and leaving my skin feeling supple and clean. I followed the directions that state to pat in any excess product. I wasn't sure whether to follow up with my hydrating toners, or skip to my Hyaluronic Acid (HA). Since skin needs moisture to make HA most effective, I patted on one layer of hydrating toner, a layer of HA, followed by a moisturizer to help lock in the hydration. I think this charcoal pad is gentle enough to use daily, if need be. However, I have been using it 2-3x a week. You will have to experiment to see what is best for you. My 40 something rosacea skin is sensitive, leans dry, and loves hydration. My skin can use an occasional boost in really purifying my pores and such. I am really liking this product so far. It just feels so gentle on my skin!<br /><br />Benefits, and a little more info:<br /><br />--Charcoal powder and peeling essence ingredient- Hydroxycinnamic Acid- provide double synergy effect for absorbing sebum and removing dead skin cells.

This one is a medium weight oil that initially smells very lightly scented. It's a very ""cologne"" type scent which I really don't care for. I am more into the woodsy, tea tree, sandalwood type scents. At first smell, this beard oil had a very light scent however once applied, this scent lasts a very long time. This is where I had a hard time with it. I like to put my beard oil on in the morning and night after brushing my teeth and I was still able to smell this beard oil into the next morning, which might have been a good thing had I enjoyed the scent. The beard oil itself as I said earlier, is a medium weight, and has a decent hold and is actually a nice overall beard oil but I ended up giving it to my son, as I personally didn't like the scent at all.",0

This one is a bit heavier and you will want to probably lay down while you have this on so that it doesn't slip. Follow the Directions: STEP 1. Remove the film<br />Clear up the skin with toner after cleansing, take the mask pack and remove the white film on one side. STEP 2. Attach the mask pack.  Attach the upper half with your eyes at the center and the lower half with your mouth at the center. Tip! It is better to attach the lower part first. STEP 3. Absorption. Remove the mask after 30 minutes and absorb the essence remaining on the skin by lightly tapping it with your fingers.

Long before they became something you could buy at your local pharmacy so I’m used to reading the adorable translations on the back (see photo)<br /><br />That aside the mask is a little on the small side and I think I have an average sized face. It does stretch though and the benefit is that it doesn’t get in your hair. Lots of serum with this one, or mask juice as I like to call it<br />so at the end of the mask time you have enough to apply extra to your face a neck.<br /><br />I left it for the full 20 minutes and my skin did feel soft and moisturised.  I used it after a transatlantic flight and my skin really needed the hydration. Obviously you won’t see any miracles after one use but do make it part of your weekly or twice weekly routine for maximum effect.<br /><br />Don’t be tempted to leave it on longer or sleep with it. All masks will just dry out and negate the benefits.<br /><br />This is a nice addition to my sheet mask collection.",1

It comes with a total of 12 eye shadows, including 8 mattes with warm and cold tone browns and 4 shimmers, 2 warm and 2 cold tones there. I like that this palette allows you to cold or warm tone.<br /><br />The eye shadows are highly pigmented and are beautiful brown shades. Even though they are highly pigmented they blend out easily, including the darkest brown in the palette. When I used the shimmers I was not able to apply them with just a brush, but when I used my fingers they applied easily with a huge payoff. They were beautiful shimmers. The one thing missing in this eye palette is a very light colored shimmer for highlighting your brow bone and your inner eye corner. Plus I also like using lighter colors for the eye lid so I wished the shimmers were a bit lighter, or at least had one lighter one in the mix.<br /><br />This is a beautiful set with very nice mattes and shimmers that blend nicely and give you gorgeous looks for any occasion.",1

AGTW6ZGPUAORQ7X6CNBP6PJW7OTA,B07VGBBNTH,4,2020-02-06 02:36:12.534,A Great Combination,"I love the combination of this shampoo and conditioner. Both smell like sweet coconut.<br />The shampoo has a thick and luxurious lather and definitely feels like it adds volume to my hair.<br />The conditioner is thick, but light, a bit like a body butter. It softens my hair and leaves it extremely soft and silky.<br />The only reason I can't give these products five stars is because I think they're a bit overpriced. Yes, they create great results, but so do a lot of comparable brands that are less than half the price.",1

AHT6AM6BNIZUHFJB5V2M6XM72G7Q,B082VKPJV5,5,2020-02-06 04:07:36.523,Great for working hands,"This is a great set if your hands regularly get dirty or dry. There's a barrier cream that can be used as a hand lotion, charcoal exfoliating hand soap, and a thick hand cream. There is a faint scent, but it's clean smelling if anything. The soap says you can use it with or without water. I wouldn't eat anything with my hands without using water with it though. The heavy cream is really nice to out on just before bed, just the tiniest amount will take care of your hands. Both creams soak in quickly and aren't greasy at all. I wash my hands it seems like a thousand times a day and these keep them from being tight and dry.",1
AEQOG6H24VT6ATMKDKOY34SDUWWA,B07YC9GNKS,5,2020-02-06 05:45:31.936,A Perfect Beauty Blender and Puff Set.,"This quality JPNK Makeup tool set with four differently contoured beauty blenders, four puff cushions, a super nice shadow/liner brush and cute blender holder has everything I need to go crazy with my face. I use a mix of formulas and powders so I love that I can have one tool designated for one medium or shade. That really cuts down on washing them and, ultimately, they’ll last longer. Half the blenders are angled to get at the right areas perfectly and they hold/blend makeup great, as do the puffs -those are wonderful with powder. A storage case/bag would’ve been nice to complete the set though.<br /><br />LOVE the springy rosegold holder. Not only does it look nice enough to leave out on a counter or shelf but it is a game changer when it comes to drying these things. It’s also helpful to hold and switch out as you’re doing your makeup, to keep track of what’s on which one, etc. And it just looks pretty with one of the lovely colors resting in it.<br />The duel eyeshadow and liner brush is surprisingly very impressive. I used it on a whim and it worked my eye makeup better than pristine brands.<br /><br />The overall quality of everything is excellent. I only wish this came with some sort of storage or carrying case/bag. That would’ve been awesome, but at this value I’m not complaining.",1

It''s a rather genius way to apply hair gel to those little baby hairs that always make you look like you just electrocuted yourself.  The wand tip is spaced nicely (the kind you want when applying mascara) No scent, dries clear, doesn't feel oily to touch.  Price point is reasonable for what you get.  Easy to take with you since it works just like a mascara case.",1

This product has light coconut scent. It comes off really easily with water and soap. Great product for photoshoots or a night out.

I was super impressed by how refreshing these feel.  Despite the charcoal, they are rather smooth but do exfoliate to a degree.<br /><br />First off these are very well packaged.  They come incredibly moist, not dried out at all.  Hard to believe there are 60 of them in the container but there are.  Despite it being a little small one wipe is more than enough for a single usage because of how much moisture is in each wipe.<br /><br />These work really well on dry skin.  They don’t feel oily but they certainly feel like the ingredients are being absorbed by my skin.  They have a faint scent that is pleasant and just as refreshing as they feel.  The price is fair given how many you get and the quality of them.  All around this is a great product.",1

That orange goop with pumice in it is our normal heavy duty hand cleaner, this soap is equivalent to that soap without the orange scent. You definitely do need water for it to be effective even though the bottle claims you don't. The hand cream is a great heavy duty healing lotion, similar to eucerin. I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in the ease of cleanymy hands after using the barrier cream however.",1
AH5OTJDIHBG4SYLRYWKS7MR7NWUQ,B07RD8KL9D,3,2020-02-07 14:03:14.114,Works better as a body mist because of the strong scent.,"(A thought: If you think of this as more of a body mist instead of a face mist, you may be happier with it. The strong perfumed scent is a little much to take sprayed directly on the face. However, when after toweling off from a shower, I sprayed this over my body, and even a little on my damp hair before blow-drying, with just a tiny spritz around my face, and it did much better—I smelled good and it’s not as strong as a regular perfume would be.)<br /><br />I love facial mists. They soothe and calm my skin, and refresh my face, and my mood. I want to give this 4 stars because it seems to be a nice mist, but there are unknowns. I’m giving it 3 stars based on how I like the feel of it, and the scent, though strong, is nice but a bit much to spray in my face—<br /><br />This Valjean face mist in Glow comes in a really nice heavy glass bottle—I like glass bottles because I can reuse them, or I can check to make sure they can be recycled, which is important to me. But reusing them by making my own face mist is nice—would be great if Valjean offered refillable options so once this bottle is emptied, I can put in more of the same product.<br /><br />This mist feels amazingly refreshing. You’ll need to note that it has a pretty strong scent. And the scent is kind of a perfume scent; that was a surprise to me. I wasn’t sure I liked that at first, and still I have to be careful when I spritz it.<br /><br />However, I like this scent. And though it can seem to be strong when I first spray it, it doesn’t overpower me or linger too long. If you spray it and it lands on your clothes, the scent will linger longer but it’s soft and I like the tones of the scent. But, again, on the face I have to be very careful.<br /><br />There isn’t a lot of information about the company or the product on this Amazon page, which is puzzling, for I’d like to know a bit more about the product I’m putting on my face. I googled the company and couldn’t find much there either. Except for a dermatology site that indicated the same thing I did: why doesn’t this company list more about their products.<br /><br />Am I just spritzing perfumed water on my face with a few minerals added? How much? What’s the perfume scent? They don’t even tell me what the scent is. However, on the back of the bottle is the list of ingredients and I suppose that helps. But I’d like more on this Amazon page, or that I can google.<br /><br />To that end, I’ll continue to use the facial mist for times I need a boost in mood or I’m sweaty after a workout or it’s hot in the summer.",0

I got this because my daughter would have a little fly-a-ways when she placed her hair in a ponytail and they tend to be stubborn fly-a-ways at that. Well, I put a small amount on her hair and the hair laid flat and perfect. I decided I would try it in my son's hair and I prefer using it for him and it has become apart of his everyday grooming. It allow me to make his hair look fuller has he has very thin curly hair which makes it so that you can see his scamp in many places because of the tightness of his curls.

It is in very classy blue bottle and packed with some very good ingredients like almond oil, Vitamin C, E and K, and Kale, and you will feel that.<br /><br />First when you use it, you will notice this heavenly smell of coconut! I love coconut so when a lotion smells of coconut and makes me smell of it, well I am 100% in favor of it. But it gets better. Once you use this on your skin, it leaves you with super soft, beautiful looking skin that smells of coconut. You don't need a lot of this lotion and it quickly and fully absorbs into your skin.<br /><br />This for me is a perfect body lotion.",1

It applies easily and leaves your lips feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy or tacky. They taste of tangerine which is great. I admit, for lip balms I want one that has a good flavor at this point and this one delivers 100%. It is packed with great for your lips ingredients such as hemp seed oil, Vitamin E and olive oil and no, it does not taste like olive oil. It is cruelty free which is another bonus in my eyes.<br /><br />It was a bit tricky to open though but once you get it it is actually a neat design, instead of twisting it on the bottom you twist it right by the bottom of the cap.",1

Great gift for someone.,"I am a fan of MARLOW products...I have several others not included in this set and all are great. I'll break down each product briefly below.<br /><br />BAG: Very nice, basic black but well padded and holds it's shape. I basic in shape but I higher quality then usual.<br /><br />SOAP: Great balsam/fir scent. Excellent balance of exfoliation and suds. Leaves body invigorated, soft and smelling great!<br /><br />SHAVE: Has a tea scent, hint of some sort of alcohol. Builds into a creamy texture, not much sud but decent coverage. Does it's job. Finishes with a clean scent.<br /><br />FACE WASH: Nice balsam/fir scent to it. A little goes a long way! Very slick, seems to not penetrate but wash the exterior of skin. Takes some work to wash off. Finishes with a green tea scent and refreshed.<br /><br />FACE MOISTURIZER: Has a tea/alcohol scent at first...Goes on smooth. Dries fairly quickly, leaving a sweet green tea scent. Leaves face feeling soft not oily.<br /><br />POMADE: Great scent, more cologne like. Goes on easy, not too tacky or slick. Does a decent job.<br /><br />LIP BALM: Awesome balm!!! At first I thought it was an odd addition to the set. But man I love this balm. Goes on with a hint of sweet tea. Not waxy, not glossy, just a perfect balance that keeps lips moisturized.",1

I really can't evidence which one is my favorite as I tried them all and love them all.

She likes it best because it has both round and flat sides, and a tip. It has held up to daily use, and washes up well, too. She has used a wide variety of beauty blenders over the years and says these sponges blend as well as any other.

I chose the dark blue to try first and it looked stunning when done!  The part I hate with gels is getting them off, but I'll work on getting better at that.

I know others mentioned that they found the combs to be sharp on the edges when combing. The one wide-tooth comb has blunted tines but the other three have pointed tines. However, those pointed tine ones were not sharp on my scalp. I have short to medium fine curly hair and these passed through my hair easily (wet or dry) and I did not feel scratched. I actually like the points massaging my scalp because on the combs I received, they were not super sharp.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I cannot tell if this set is wooden as it claims. It is possible they are wooden but because they are highly polished, they feel and look like plastic. I attend craft shows and it is possible to get a plastic feel and look to wood, so unless I broke one of the combs in half (which I am unwilling to do), I cannot tell. I still think the current price of $9.99 is reasonable even they are plastic.",1

I feel very lucky that this particular set fits my nail bed very well- so much so that I barely have to file them to fit, and they conform to the curvature of my nail as well. These are on the slightly thinner side, which I prefer, because they feel and look a lot more natural on top. The length is perfect too- not too long.<br /><br />I lightly buffed the top of these and painted them w regular nail polish. If I polish without buffing, they can crinkle a bit - I have not tried gel yet tho, and that probably will work out w a clear top if I want to keep the white tip look. Even without polish, the buffed look just looks like a beautiful pink matte polish, as if I had painted them that way on purpose. Some commenters have said the white part scratches off somewhat easily. This is true. But, I love these for the natural look and great fit, and am buying another set now, so I never run out.",1

The ingredients are good and there are no animal ingredients and no animal testing.  I wish more companies were like that.  My lips have been especially dry this winter, perhaps due to a new medication, and this balm softens them and lasts fairly well.  It is a softer product than some balms, especially those petroleum-based ones.  It doesn't drag across your lips but glides on nicely.  The diameter is wider than some others, so it takes only one swipe across each lip.  Quite a nice product.",1

Apparently I have accumulated too many products over the last few months and was in need of additional storage. This one is similar to another one I have. Just like with other ones with a lazy Susan the shelves are adjustable which is great since you have products of different size. On the top it has different sections so you can put some items like small bottles, eye liners, brushes, mascara and so on in there to keep those organized as well, which my other two lazy Susan organizers do not have, so this is kind of neat in my eyes. All my organizers are just a tad different so I keep them for different purposes, this one is great for lotions, dropper bottles and mascaras and such. It is very sturdy and a great addition to keep my things organized.",1

I have very sensitive skin due to seborrheic dermatitis, so I have to be very careful with skincare products. Why do I always feel the need to test them on Sunday when I have work the next day? No worries, my skin will look great and If I can find the time I may do another treatment in the morning to give my skin a little more radiance. There is no denying the results.<br /><br />Pro Tip: They work even better when you put them in the freezer for about 15 minutes before use. It will help tighten the pores up and feels extra refreshing!<br /><br />** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

It’s the only thing I absolutely detest about gel polish. This is the second steam gel remover machine that I have used. This one feels like it’s more substantial and well-built than the other one(steam off brand). Comes with 2 plastic acetone dishes and 4 additional finger hole sheets. I like that it has a click on/off button versus the push button which was the reason I returned the last one(Plus it only powered on 20% of the time).<br /><br />  I use my electric nail drill to take off the top coat and wear down the polish a bit. It gives the steam somewhere to penetrate. If you skip this step, it won't be effective. Also, make sure to use 100% acetone. With the right steps, it takes off my gel polish (even with glitter) in 10 minutes. Depending on the brand and how many layers of polish, it usually takes 10-15 minutes to get the polish to curl up and then with a steel tool, the polish easily pushes off.<br /><br />The timer on this one seems to turn off after five minutes but I didn’t really mind that, you just click it off and turn it back on to continue. This one isn’t as comfortable to rest your fingers in as the other one, but as long as it gets the gel polish off easily I’m willing to deal with it. After 2+ months of use, I’m happy with this! So much easier, faster and kinder to your nails.",1

My wife has curly hair that can be difficult to tame.  When this brush arrived, my younger daughter who has very long curly hair wanted to try it out.  When she brushed through her hair, she felt it reduced the static and made her hair feel softer.  So much so that my wife never got the chance to use as my daughter claimed it as hers.  The brush handle is made with a thick, durable feeling wood.  The bristles are much more durable and pull through the hair better than those with plastic or silicone bristles.

It's heavier than the usual thin almost paper or gel like masks that a lot of them seem to be. This one definitely has a bit more to it. It's also a two piece mask which is great in some ways because sometimes I looks like a one person comedy routine trying to get the masks on right while they flip and flop all over.<br />With this mask you put the bottom part then the top by your eyes, it makes it a lot easier. Then you leave it on for at least 20 minutes ( though it says to leave it on for 30 so I did that). When you take it off you gently pat the left over into your skin.<br />It leaves your skin feeling so soft and really well moisturized. I feel like it did a very nice job with firming up the skin as well. I have only used two of these so far, one a week over two weeks, and have really liked the way my skin looked and felt after each use. I would recommend giving these a try if you can.

Rather than exfoliate it actually just seemed to dry out my lips and not just a little bit. It wasn't fun. I tried it a few times, as directed. Just apply a small pea-sized amount to the lips using a finger-tip, scrub gently in a circular motion to remove the dead skin cells for about 30 seconds then rinse or eat off remaining sugar. All of that was done, rinsed not eaten though the one thing that was good was that it didn't taste half bad. Alas, my poor lips were left in worse shape than ever. Dry and roughed up.

I will not wear any other polish now -- to avoid future infections. This is a nice product.

AFOA2HTRX44FROMC3WKNJD74UALA,B082XYPBRL,5,2020-02-24 02:34:44.699,Meet my new best friend!,"OMFG this brush is amazing! I have 3B style curls and I'm also biracial so my hair is really porous and a bit on the fragile side. In its curly state it's a pain to care for but the traditional blow dry and flat iron method is both tedious and damaging to my hair.<br /><br />When wet to straight irons came out, I immediately hopped on board because it just made more sense that heating my hair while wet would be less damaging to it. Through this I got hooked lol. But even with that it is a bit tedious.... though it did help me figure out that I could flat iron my hair dry and skip the blow dryer.<br /><br />My boyfriend has one of these brushes and I tried it as a quick way to straighten my hair in the am. I was SUPER impressed! But it had some design flaws that made me seek my own, and landed me here.<br /><br />From what I've seen comparing this brush to the more popular Rinfy and his brush, they've reallly improved upon the original design concepts. Most notably, the buttons are on the front of the handle and not the sides, down near the cord instead of anywhere up near the head.  This along with the way they're shaped to be concaved makes it highly unlikely they'll be pressed by accident. But even if you do press them by accident, the device automatically locks them about 30s after the temperature is set. If you want to change the temp or turn it off after that, you need to click the power button twice to unlock them.<br /><br />The teeth are not only steep enough to accommodate my thick hair, but there's also way more of them packed more densely together. This seems to make this brush MUCH quicker at straightening my hair, and it can also get it board straight. The other brushes have only gotten it as close as a little wave.<br /><br />Since my hair is so thick, I also have to place my hand on the bristles while I pull the brush through so it gets all my hair in it. This is the only model I've tried which hasn't burned me even once while using it so far. The teeth are so densely packed that there is no way for a finger or the side of my hand to slip down past the safety portion of it.<br /><br />Quick heating? Honestly I don't know why anyone tries to claim that.... I've never seen any heated hair product heat up quickly. My stove doesn't even heat up quickly. I hardly expect my straightening iron or brush to defy the laws of physics so I don't have to wait a few minutes for it to heat up. That's why I turn it on BEFORE I'm ready to use it. 😉<br /><br />All joking aside though, this really is a fantastic brush. It even FEELS high quality. Nice weight, premium plastics, slick design. It will fit right in with other hair devices no matter how pricey they are.",1

AFQQQ5LGNSQUEBGDCYBAZZE5T3DA,B0848VJ18X,5,2020-02-24 18:30:41.506,Top Notch,Native makes some of the best natural deodorants on the market. They're just as effective as the drugstore brands. I like this set because you get three different scents. My favorite is the peony. The scents are all fresh and light. They won't clash with other fragrances you wear. This set is perfect for gifting. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

But it does not work well with my hair at all. It doesn’t glide, the steam feature is difficult to use, my hair feels damaged after using it, and I’m not at all happy with it. I read the instructions to make sure it wasn’t user error. I have baby fine naturally curly hair. Don’t know if that plays a part in it not working for me or not.",0

They smell great and are very versatile. Mix them with your favorite oil (I like coconut) and apply topically or add a few drops to a diffuser for a peaceful night sleep. I recently had a cold and mixed the peppermint and coconut oil and applied to my chest for a cough. It was soothing and helped with the sinuses as well. Makes a great gift because it comes in a cute little box as well.",1

Goes on a bit thicker then your standard nail polish.  Cure time in a UV/Lamp is accurate, for first coat, I found that to get fully dry you need about 2 or 3 (60 sec) more before apply topcoat or your nails remain tacky for a while.<br /><br />I haven’t used this brand before but so far I am enjoying it.  The polish hasn’t chipped off easily.<br /><br />Overall, I will continue to use this.",1

I am trying to save money and my nails were just so thin and brittle. I wanted something to put on top of my bare nails to make them stronger while they grow out. This stuff works...it dries fast, makes a strong barrier, protects my nails from peeling, splitting, or breaking BUT it does tend to peel off in about three to four days. So you need to reapply it. Sometimes I reapply it over the older coat and after two or three coats of this I remove it and start over. It has not yellowed my nails and they look good.",1

The tips are curved well but are kind of wide (they don't come to a point) and they flex a lot.  It takes very little pressure to get them to flex and as far as using this to scrape your teeth... well you would get almost no scraping.  This would be great for introducing kids to what the dentist does or for people with super sensitive gums.  I did give 4 stars as it it a good tool for removing paint from delicate surfaces and it is non marring.  Handle is comfortable to hold and I actually use this when clean my air guns as the chambers are small and tight and this won't cause damage and can get into the tight spaces.,1

I needed to hold my fingers as close to the flat end as possible to get good leverage. Even then, I couldn't remove the debris.<br /><br />The sharp end of the pick works a bit better in removing debris from between my teeth; but for those debris that are really stuck, this pick can't get the debris out because the end keeps flexing.<br /><br />This tool doesn't do a good job of removing resistant particles/debris from my teeth.",0

It smells nice, too, which is also a plus!<br />My hair is not that of a teen or even young adult anymore so it's been through a lot. When looking for shampoo and conditioning products I tend to look closer at those that claim to make hair stronger, reduce breakage, and things with words like ""restore"" and ""fortify"". These hit the mark so I decided to give them a shot.<br />I've been using them about three weeks and I think that they are definitely doing my hair some good. It looks healthy and feels very soft. The conditioner does a good job with tangles and knots. I do sometimes still use a leave in conditioner or separate type of moisture just because it's winter my hair is increasingly dry on any given day depending. I can't tell for sure about the breakage but it does seem stronger. I suppose in many ways they go hand in hand. It has more pull to it so it's not snapping and breaking as much.<br />I like this. A little goes a long way as well which is nice.",1

The quality seems very high and the oils smell wonderful.  The perfectly packaged set would make a great gift for someone beginning with essential oils or for an old hand since it contains three of the most commonly used oils.<br /><br />Personally, I don't use oils medicinally unless you count the calming benefits of lavender in your mister. I use them either in a mister or atomizer or as a dot of fragrance on my wrist. Essential oils don't cause headaches or change their scent when I wear them.<br /><br />The kit includes lavender, lemon, and peppermint. All three smell absolutely wonderful, whether you use them in a mister or add a drop to your washer's rinse cycle. I always add a drop or two to loads containing our bedding. It's delightful.<br /><br />I would definitely buy Bloomy's brand again. I'm very impressed with the fragrance and quality.",1

So I just will these instead!

AHRUV3HZFPZEPRWEMSYMVBAJXFFQ,B07Z4CVTRP,4,2020-02-28 05:40:15.171,"Color, ingredients","The frosted glass looks good. The color of the plastic and silicone parts is darker than in photos, though. Judging from the website it's supposed to be off-white, actually called ""classic linen,"" but the ones they sent out seem to be more beige. If that doesn't suit, there's also a ""midnight blue"" color available, which is a sort of medium gray blue judging from the photos (which may or may not be reliable).<br /><br />Or you can take the silicone skirt off this--it's made so it's removable, good for occasional cleaning--and replace the push top with whatever color you want. It's a standard size. I think it looks better without the skirt even with the beige top. Just be careful not to break the bottle. It feels pretty sturdy.<br /><br />The scent of the soap is lavender with citrus. (Not coconut--that's in the photo because it's where some of the saponified oil comes from.)<br /><br />It washes well, doesn't leave any noticeable residue for me, though I suppose the aloe juice is intended to moisturize some.<br /><br />It comes oddly over-packaged but in cardboard that can be recycled or biodegraded.<br /><br />The ingredients given at the website are:<br /><br />Saponified coconut oil, saponified olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, citric acid, sodium chloride (table salt), natural essential oil blend, vitamin E.<br /><br />It's not clear why potassium soap is listed separately from the saponified oils, since that's what potassium soap is, oils turned into soap by the addition of potassium hydroxide (potash).",1

The stickers are pre-printed and pre-cut to fit perfectly into the little window. If you don’t have a label exactly matching what you have in one of the bottles, just choose another label and remember what you called that one. The labels are a bit tricky to remove from the backing, though. Of the four I used, every single one of them took a part of the backing paper with it, and I had to peel it off again.<br />It is easy to turn the top of the main container to select a lotion. The lid clicks into place on top of each bottle. It takes a few pumps the first time to get the lotion started, but after that they are all easy to pump.<br />I would like some sort of lock – maybe being able to have the pump handle stop in between bottles. That way I don’t have to worry about the lotion accidentally being pumped while it is in my luggage. (That hasn’t happened, but the possibility concerns me.)",1

They are a good assortment and well coated so they don't snag your hair, the clip snaps tight too to really keep a hold on things. They are very glossy, and if you like bright colors there are some brights in there, but also pastels and earth tones. I kept the neutral ones and small of the more muted colors and am giving the rest to my 13-year-old niece who loves bright colors.",1

The pillow is huge and provides a lot of support for your head. It's held securely in place by the suction cups.<br /><br />This is a nice gift for anyone who takes a lot of baths. However, if you only do so occasionally, you might find that the size of this pillow might be a deterrent. It's not space saving and does take up a lot of room for storage.

It makes my skin tingle and would be excellent in the summer months when you need to bring your body temperature down. The scent is like menthol-eucalyptus, but a bit sweeter. The lather is very thick and smooth, and it rinses away leaving my skin feeling cool and moisturized. The only reason for the 4-star rating is the price. $15 is a bit much for 6 ounces of product.",1

It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face and let sit for about 15 to 20 minutes. So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses. It feeds your skin it feels like with the serum it contains and leaves your skin soft and healthy. Your face will look and feel great. This is a nice little treat for yourself.

There is no bright orange or pale yellow, there are a lot of browns and many more muted pastel colors. The package arrived open with clips strewn about the box. That being said, they stay in my daughter's super fine hair better than the clips of this type we have used before. They have stayed in through a full school day and gymnastics class without falling out. They do have some rainbow colors, just not as many as we'd hoped for. We got 105 clips. So it the colors are important to you, know that they are on the more pastel side of what's pictured and that there is no true orange. They don't come in a giftable package. If staying in hair is what is important to you, these can't be beat.",0

First off, it's a super flimsy and you can't use much pressure when pressing against teeth. Also, the pointed end that is supposed to clear put any food from between the teeth isn't pointed enough so you can't really get in there all the way. Last, because you cannot put enough pressure to scrape off gunk, it becomes useless.",0

It has a very strong menthol scent to it that I just am not big on. I am very sensitive to menthol smells and can't stand it. This one is very strong and overpowering.<br /><br />It does have a refreshing feel to it but the smell of menthol just overpowers everything. My skin was soft when I used it and did not dry out so that is great. So for those who like menthol this is great, but for me this just doesn't work.",0

The spray is perfect for adding a refreshing scent into a room (or a musty winter weary car interior).  Super easy to fill and the entire package is compact and fits easily into a purse or glovebox.  We also filled one bottle up with a little soapy water to spray on out house plants to take care of the fruit flies that are attracted to the flowers.  Excellent all round spray bottles.,1

This is great for those who have done some damage to their hands in some physical hand jobs where they hand up with dry and cracked hands. This gives back some moisture and heals those hands.<br /><br />Last but not least is a nice protect and moisturizer. This adds a nice barrier to your hands but also adds much needed hydration to much abused hands that are dry, cracked and scaly. When you have this on your hands it is much easy to wash and wipe away stubborn dirt.<br /><br />This is a nice little set that can also be gifted, especially for people who work with their hands like mechanics or wood workers but many others.

I also love to turn off the lights, and light some aromatherapy candles & music. There's only one thing that's missing, a bath pillow so I can lay back & rest my neck as well.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine Voices Program, I came across this 『Charyeah Bath Pillow for Bathtub/Spa』.<br /><br />Unboxing revealed that it's a decent sized bath pillow, not too large that it takes up too much room around your bathtub, but large enough to hold your head/neck comfortably.<br /><br /> INSTALLATION<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />Since I've never owned one, it would have been nice to have a picture of how it should sit in the tub; but eventually I figured it out since there's really only two ways to place it. For those of you having issues, remember to put the thin, rectangular strip portion around the rim of the bathtub, and the wide part on the slanted portion of the tub & that's where your neck and head would rest on while soaking in the bathtub.<br /><br /> REMOVAL<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />A few words of cautions, after you're done, make sure you slide the bathtub pillow suction cups off the tub instead of pulling them off, trust me - you pull enough times, the suction cups will no doubt be severed from the pillow main body.<br /><br /> The VERDICT<br />🛁🛁🛁🛁🛁<br />  I think this bathtub pillow works well, allowing me to get the true relaxation bubble bath experience that it's designed for. As long as you follow the aforementioned tips, it really does the job. It would have been nice to have a hook so that upon removal I can hang it inside the bathtub area like bathtub caddy or showerhead allowing it to dripdry.<br /><br />💓💖💕🛁🛁 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED🛁🛁💕💖💓",1

It added a good amount of length to be honest and did add a little bit of volume though. I do believe you can build this up to more thickness but then you would get that spidery look that I do not care for.<br /><br />The wand is a nice thin wand that helps not making a mess all over. The bristles are shorter and make it very easy to use. The mascara is smudge proof. I had it on for a solid 16 hours and it did not budge until I used a makeup remover and it came off very easy at that point.<br /><br />This is a nice mascara and it will cost you $18.

I compare that to my Radha Beauty lavender that doesn’t have a weird odor with it; I love it and it costs less though you have to buy a collection.<br /><br />As well, for about the same price as this Bloomy, there is a blend of lavender and vanilla that I adore: Marpac Snooze Button. It is my favorite and there’s no weird off-odor.<br /><br /> I will have to toss it, as it’s that unpleasant to me.<br /><br />It’s a tiny bottle, but most essential oils I have purchased are small.

I’ve been using this coconut based hand soap daily and find it pleasant. It glides and lathers well when I rub my hands together and stays on my hands long enough to be thorough washing. This soap isn’t overly drying, though I almost always need lotion after hand washing. The lavender scent from essential oils is light, which is a plus as I’m not a fan of heavy scent. The container holds 12 oz. and the company sells 16 oz. refills (currently $6.95) in a paper based container styled like a milk carton to reduce plastic waste.<br /><br />The glass container has a modern design that looks nice countertop. It has a beige or taupe color silicone (or similar) material on the bottom and lower sides that prevents slipping and adds breakage protection. The plastic pump is also beige and good quality but may not last as long as the glass container. Beige isn’t my favorite color but it’s neutral and the company offers a blue shade that looks pretty in the photo. This soap has coconut oil, olive oil, potassium soap, aloe juice, vitamin E, citrus acid, sodium chloride and a natural essential oil blend (not in that order).

Product comes in a plastic squeeze tube containing 6 ounces of gel. A little dab is all that's needed on a scrubby towel to generate rich lather and provide a proper wash.

They are think and luscious but are not cartoony.  I have had this pair on for 4 days now and still look great.  Everyone thinks I put them on daily but, nope I sleep in them and they do not get bent, fold, or lift while I sleep.

I’ve been trying a 3-pack of full size scented Native deodorant sticks in Peony & Jasmine Tea, Sweet Almond & Honey and Linen & Cotton varieties. The Peony is a citrusy floral scent, and the Linen one smells crisp and fresh. The Sweet Almond smells a little sweet like honey and has a light coconut scent. I especially like the Peony and Linen scents as they work best with my chemistry, but all three smell nice and none of the fragrance is too heavy. All three came with protective shields under the caps.<br /><br />The unscented is still my favorite, but the scented varieties also work well for me and do seem to neutralize bacteria so my armpits don’t get stinky. While not an antiperspirant, I haven’t noticed my armpits getting wet even when the weather gets hotter. These scented deodorants have tapioca starch and sodium bicarbonate (just like the unscented) that I assume helps my pits stay feeling dry. My armpits don’t turn a weird color or feel irritated, and I haven’t noticed any white flakes on my clothes or any staining. The fragranced assortment smells good and is really effective for me. Definitely recommend. 5 stars.",1

The last time I was at the hair dresser I mentioned that and the hair dresser stated that the best scrunchie are these little spiral hair ties that are popping up recently. They supposedly don't cause split ends and hair breakage. I figured why not give them a shot.<br /><br />These hair ties will not get soaked if you go for a swim, obviously, which is great. I did notice however that when you just pull it out of your hair you will end up pulling out some hair. I suggest you pull it out gently, preferably by either untangling it once first or by holding your pony tail at the base firmly and then pulling it out.<br /><br />These spirals are fairly large and I like these a lot. They are blue but with a tie dye kind of effect in them, super cute. After using them for a while they can stretch out a bit, but fear not, you can just put them in warm/hot water and they shrink right back to what they used to be and your have your spiral hair tie back. Or if you just don't use them for a bit they will shrink back on their own. In this pack you only get 3 for $10 so these are bit more on the expensive side to some others I have seen and gotten.",1

Bits of the powder sprayed over various areas of the bathroom sink, and as I continued to brush and spit, the sink itself was covered with a combination of water/saliva/charcoal.<br />There was a taste of the powder (a bit bitter taste) on my tongue as I brushed.<br /><br />Rinsing with water did not remove all the charcoal in my mouth; so I brushed again with toothpaste, and rinsed with more water. That did the trick.<br />It took a bit of time to clean up the mess I made.<br /><br />The next occasions that I brushed using this activated charcoal, I did not brush as vigorously, and made less of a mess, as I adjusted to how to use the product.<br /><br />In the last 3 weeks since using this, I have noticed the top part of a teeth (the top 5% of it) of the front four teeth are slightly brighter than the rest of the teeth.<br /><br />The tongue scraper is a helpful addition to my dental hygiene routine.",0

The two colors are nice, but I am sure once a person starts gel polish, they will love it and buy a set of colors that suit them.  Now, the only thing I would change about this set is the UV light as it is very small.  I already had a larger one and am comfortable using my big one as I can fit all four fingers under it with ease.  Not that I have fat fingers or anything, but I just feel the included UV light is a tad smaller than most women would like.

I was super skeptical as I was doing my sisters nails. She has much more elegant hands and long nails so hence why she was my model for trying this gel kit. The instructions are clear and explain what is used for what and how to use them in the proper steps. The instructions also come with tips which were helpful. You get a UV light, a buffer and pads, topcoat, peel off base coat, two colors, prep it and end it solution. The UV light is a plug in and not battery operated. It is a bit of a time-consuming process – it took me about an hour to do my sisters nails. I love the gray that comes in this set, but the pink leaves a bit to be desired. The gray applies beautifully and isn’t translucent unlike the pink. The pink was still translucent even after two coats. The instructions state to cure it for 45 seconds (well this is how long the UV light stays on) but her nails were still sticky. So, I cured them several more times and they remained sticky. I finally decided to just finish them with the topcoat. I cured them then the instructions stated to take a pad with the end it solution and rub her nails to rid the tacky coating. I was super nervous about this step and was worried that all my work and her patience would’ve been for nothing. After wiping her nails, I didn’t see any polish transfer or dents on her nails.  Which I had let out a sigh of relief. I suppose they’re tacky because of the sort of polish this is and didn’t need to cure it as much as I did. This was my first time doing anything like this, but I think her nails turned out nice. I’m sure with practice, I’ll get even better. I really love that you can get salon nails from the comfort of your own home. I also believe this kit is well worth the money. What you pay for this kit is what you’d pay in one salon visit, at least for me. I am so pleasantly surprised by how nice this is and so glad I decided to give it a try!",1

It comes in a similar tube as your eye mascara does and also has a similar wand to it. The gel is clear and very lightweight. It feels almost like water when you have it on your hair really. It is not sticky or greasy really.<br /><br />I was surprised that it works quite well and the staying power is pretty good as well. It is fairly cheap to so not a big investment there and definitely reasonable. I am not sure how big of an issue it really is though to get something like it. I guess if you are going to a big event and you want everything to be just perfect this is a product for it, but on a day to day basis I wouldn't really bother with it.

It is very easy to use, basically a sheet mask that you put over your face. I like the fact that it comes in two pieces so you really can make it fit perfectly to your face. The one pieces are just one fits all kind of masks and lets face it, not all faces are the same scie or shape and therefore they just don't all fit. With this one you have a lot of nice wriggle room which is great.<br /><br />It is very easy to put on. Once it is on you let it sit for about 15 to 20 minutes (btw, if you go longer you get more of the goodies). So just have a good show on tv or a book handy to read. I did notice that it is fairly heavy though but it amazingly did not slip on me but I was afraid that it may.<br /><br />This mask smells beautifully of roses and for once not overpowering of it. I am not the biggest fan of the smell of roses but this one was pleasant since it was not this cloying smell of it. This is a collagen mask and when you remove it you can tell how soft your face is. I really liked this mask but it is on the more expensive side. You get 4 masks in the box for $25, so each is about $6, so that is a bit on the higher end of sheet masks but they are very nice.",1

I already tried their [[ASIN:B07VQY9ZP2 WeeklyPoint Cosmetic Saffron mask sheet]] and found it to be very messy and just okay. This one is less messy.<br /><br />There are ten individually wrapped masks in this package. The instructions are in broken English but still easy to understand. I applied this mask to my clean face -- there are holes for eyes, nose, and mouth. It was somewhat wet but not dripping wet as their other mask. I prefer less solution, so this was perfect. I let it stay on for exactly 20 minutes and then removed the mask and wiped off the excess. My face felt moisturized and silky. I reveled in the soft rose fragrance the entire time.  However, the claims that it brightens the skin and protects them from wrinkles is unfounded in my opinion. On the other hand, the rose fragrance is calming and wonderful and the moisturizing effect is silky and these are my two favorite traits of this moisturizing sheet.<br /><br /> ",1

It is pretty much scentless so that is boring but it does come in a beautiful frosted little dropper bottle. The serum is however just ok.<br /><br />The serum is fairly lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. The downside with it however is it leaves your skin tacky and that feeling fades but never really fully goes away. There is always a bit of that tacky residue on your skin. I did not notice any significant brightening effects either so it did not come through on that promise either.<br /><br />All in all this is just ok to be honest. I didn't really like how my face felt and it didn't really brighten it either. It does have some ingredients that are good for my face so at least it does some good things for my face even if I don't necessarily like how it feels when it is on, but you can always put another moisturizer on.",0

The nozzle on this facial steamer is made out of aluminum which is safer. Plus the nozzle is adjustable, so that’s even better 👍🏼 This facial steamer has me doing facials like a pro 😉!

It comes with everything you need to get your nails done with a gel manicure. It has step by step instructions that are easy to follow and you end up with great looking nails.

So far I have only used the gray and really like that color a lot.<br /><br />Now what I really wish is that they have an adjunt kit where you can order more colors to go with the kit to mix it up some. Just having pink and gray is not enough in my eyes and let's face it having more options would be great where you could pick and choose other colors.<br /><br />I love the fact that you can just peel off the nail polish when you are done instead of having to use harsh chemicals to remove it. I always hated that part and that was one reason why I don't often use nail polish, that and the fact that regular nail polish is pretty damaging to your nails. Gel nail polish is actually pretty gentle to your nails and protecting at that plus it looks great.<br /><br />No complaints here, very happy with how long it took and the end results.",1

The first impression is that the aroma is extremely pleasant, followed by the gentle, slick feel of the liquid against one's skin.  It washes easily, without leaving my dry skin feeling overly tight, or over washed.  I used a light toner after washing one side of my face, my usual products (more expensive), then managed to forget to apply skin cream to either side.

I like that the material feels like a soft plush robe and the elastic inside isn't so tight that it feels like it is squeezing my head off.  Lots of of give to these and they wash well.  Functional and fun to either have or give as a gift.  These haven't gotten tangled in my hair and allow me to push my hair out of the way while I apply make up and then remove without messing up my hair either.,1

If you have puffy tired eyes that crave some tender loving care then these just may be what you need. They work so well. You put them on under your eyes after washing and drying your face. Just leave them on for 10-15 minutes and when you remove them you gently massage the product into the skin. That's it!<br />The one thing that isn't so great is that they are so hard to separate when you first open the packet and take them out. They stick together and to themselves and it's very frustrating trying to get them without losing the liquid and getting yourself all covered in it. Other than that these are a definite win.,1

The brushes, there are two different texture types, are softer then I prefer but do function as intended.  I just like a tougher scrubber on one side.  The hang loop is large enough to fit on a hook but not over a large shower stall single turn temperature handle.  Overall, this didn't / hasn't fallen apart, none of the bristles are shedding and the length is long enough to reach my entire back.",1

I’ve had highlights as well. My hair was visually damaged. Using this Magical Hair Treatment Mask, has softened my hair. Given my hair a bounce. Only use a lil bit to get outstanding results! I make sure my hair is washed clean with no conditioner used. I then use a lil bit of this product and that’s it. The irony is I told husband after my 1use this stuff is like magic, look at the difference in my hair now. He laughed and said “ Sweetheart that just may be the reason it’s called Magical Hair Treatment Mask”. I laughed so hard. There you have it. It’s called Magical Hair Treatment Mask, because it’s like magic.",1

However, these are about the nicest makeup remover pads I've used. Not like the type you’ll find at dollar stores that are thin, small and tear.<br /><br />These are sturdy and I can get by with just one at each use. They feel good on my skin. They don't leave a residue or greasy feel on your skin after use. Admittedly I do rinse off though after using any makeup remover pads with chemicals as I have sensitive skin, and get hives from some products. This hasn't happened yet using these.<br /><br />If the price doesn't bother you, go for it! They're nice and do the job.",1

The plain ones also have a heavy duty elastic in them. I have super thick long hair and these do a great job of keeping my hair in a bun.<br /><br />Ive definitely overpaid for scrunchies at urban outfitters when these are just as nice if not nicer for sooo much cheaper.

You get some simple ring scrunchies I guess they call them that are my personal favorite, mostly because the colors are absolutely amazing in this trio. Then you get a trio of bunny ear style scrunchies that is also very cute and decorative and lastly a trio of scarf scrunchies that is very decorative as well.<br /><br />In addition you get 7 hair pins to dress up your hair that are very cute. I still have to learn how to use this the right way and make them work in my hair. I have finer hair so these tend to slide out but I know there is a trick to make them stay in place.

If the paste is applied to wet hair, the hold is very firm, but the finish is not matte. If I applied it to dry hair, the finish was matte, but the hold wasn’t very firm. The most disappointing thing was the scent, which I disliked more than any other hair product I’ve ever used. Overall, a pretty average product.",0

Just keep everything where it belongs and it closes easily with a snap.<br /><br />The tools are mostly fine. They're adequately sturdy. The scissors are a little thin and flexible for tough cuts, but they're supposed to be for trimming facial hair, for which they're fine.<br /><br />The fit and finish of a few of the tools isn't the best. A couple of the nail clippers have a little overbite, where one blade doesn't perfectly align with the other, which can make for messier cuts. And a couple of the blades on the callus removers are pitted a little.<br /><br />On the whole, it's an adequate kit for nail and foot care and grooming.<br /><br />Made in China.",1

They went in and out easily. They stayed in fairly well. They were very pretty. She liked them a lot. They really made her look nice. They would also look nice for pictures. The quality was pretty decent. It is nice that it is a set and you get a bunch. I liked the variety. I was happy and would recommend it.<br />They also helped keep her hair out of her face.,1

Just some primer, concealer, eyes and mouth.<br />For me, they worked perfectly! They are pretty wet, so they took off all my makeup easily.<br />They are small, so if you use more layers of make up you maybe are going to need more than one.<br />They are soft and have a nice scent.<br />I have mixed skin and delicate. They did not hurt me, burn me, or leave my skin red.<br />After using them, my skin feels clean and moisturized.

The plastic coating is smooth throughout the coils and didn't get caught or pull my hair.  They are rather large and have a decent amount of stretch to them, you can twist them 2 or 3 times to get a tight hold.  Also, again, when removing since the edges are all smooth they didn't get tangled or caught in my hair.  While I haven't seen this issue it may come up over time since they are plastic they might loose some of there elasticity over time .",1

You get four things in this set. You'll receive a paddle brush, a rectangle comb, a detangler hair brush, and a tail comb. I don't really use the combs as much as the brushes but did give them a bit of a testing so I could type a review. I absolutely love all of these brushes and combs. They are sturdy and work very well. When used for what they are supposed to be used for specifically I thought they all held up well and did their jobs. They detangled perfectly and when used for styling they were easy to hold on to, didn't get in the way at all, and worked the hair into it's style nicely.<br />I would recommend these if you are looking for a good set of hair brushes and combs that won't cost you much.

I love that this is basically a face wash that really removes all your makeup. I don't have to get a ton of cotton ball and rub down my face like other makeup removers nor do I need to use ton of wipes. This fits into my simple routine of washing my face few times and doing a wipe down with a simple cloth to ensure it did remove the makeup like it said and continue my facial routine then go. It also does not strip the natural oils from my face so after washing my face with this, my face does not feel dry at all.",1

Its easy to apply, rubs in and absorbs well but does feel a little sticky afterwards. It doesnt have much of a smell either maybe a little like lavender but gentle. Ive been doing one pump and rubbing it on her feet and she likes the little foot massage. I could tell it helps her sleep better. She wakes up/squirms less, maybe helping her get a deeper sleep.

This cream is pretty lightweight, and has a slight pleasant smell. The primer helps reduce big pores, and soften dry skin. And also gives me a pink glow. When I apply my foundation, it doesn't look spotty, or dry. The primer makes it look smooth and even. I think it's a good deal for a 2-pack. I would buy this again.",1

The smell is pretty neutral and subtle.  It does not sting or leave any unpleasant feeling like some magnesium products.  It is not a magic lotion that will put your child to sleep instantaneously.  It will relax your child though allowing them to fall asleep with time.  More importantly it will help their quality of sleep through the night.

It's very nice and stays on you for awhile. So, you pump out the 'gel' which I would call soap except for the fact that it doesn't lather much. Instructions say to pump in your hand then apply to face. I tried that, but my face felt too dry, so I moistened it a little bit and then applied the gel. I rinsed it off well and patted my skin dry. Within seconds I felt my skin drying up. If you have really dry skin, you know what I mean - that taut feeling you try to avoid. I had to get some cream and moisturize right away. I'm guessing there must be something like alcohol in this makeup remover. If you have oily skin or perhaps you're trying to remove a heavy foundation - this may be a good choice for you. But since I wear light makeup and have very dry skin, I can't use this. I'll try it again in the summer when my skin produces more oil as the scent is really nice and makes it worth a second try.",0

My skin did feel tacky for a few minutes while it absorbed.  There is a scent to this, it isn't citrus or fruity I just can't place it.  It's very mild and isn't unpleasant I just don't know how to describe it.  My face does feel soft after using but slightly dry as well.  I have had any irritations or breakouts while using.

I have a night routine of skin care, and this is just the first step.<br /><br />Bottom line if the price doesn't bother you, go for it.

There is a tab that I press in to open the case; to close the case, I press both parts of the case together.<br /><br />b) One compartment (the side with the tab) holds:<br />  --- Nail File<br />  Works well to smooth out my nails after I trimmed them.<br />  --- Fingernail Clipper<br />  The curved blades cut my nails well. The lever has square-shaped divots that give good<br />  grip. It is a bit hard to rotate the lever around the pin; but, with continued use, it should<br />  be easier to open and close the lever. There is no nail file attached to the clipper<br />  --- Nose trimmer<br />  I did not find this to be as good at cutting my nose hairs.<br />  ---.Cuticle nipper<br />  This trims my cuticles well.<br />  --- Eyebrow trimmer<br />  This does a decent job in trimming eyebrow<br />  ---  Cuspidal/Obtuse push-type broach<br />  I didn't have a need to use this; but several family members used this, and they say it<br />  does an adequate job with their nail polish routine<br />  --- Ear pick<br />  I tried it, but I didn't like the sensation of it scraping against the inside of my ear.<br /><br />c) The other compartment holds:<br />  --- Toenail clipper<br />  Curved blades cut my toenails well; however, it does not cut my big toenail because<br />  that nail has too much fungus and is too thick. I used a different toenail clipper<br />  recommended by my foot doctor.<br />  --- Oblique nail clipper<br />  I don't use this often for cutting my nail; but I like how easily it cuts the nails. Other<br />  family members love it, and are more familiar in using it<br />  --- Nail cleaning knife<br />  I don't use this; others in my family say it works well to remove the debris under their nails.<br />  --- Tweezers<br />  My family members do not like this, because it doesn't open enough for them to use; so they went<br />  back to using their preferred tweezers<br />  --- Zig Zag callus remover<br />  --- Oblique callus remover<br />  --- Flat callus remover<br />  note: so far, those of us with calluses (including me) do not have them so thick that<br />  they need removal using these instruments.<br />  --- Dead skin fork<br />  a family member used it; she says it is quite useful in removing the loose skin right<br />  around her cuticle area<br />  --- Ear pick (has something like a serrated shape, perhaps)<br />  I much prefer this ear pick; it felt more natural and is like what I used in the past.<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a pick)<br />  --- Acne tool (one end with a circular loop; other end with a scoop)<br />  None of our family members currently have acne, so we haven't had a chance to try it;<br />  but, we have similar instruments just like these, and those worked well when we've<br />  needed to deal with our skin issues.<br /><br />Lastly: I would have liked the case to be slightly larger, so that it is easier to remove all these instruments. When I removed all the instruments, some of which I used, others which my family members used, and then put the instruments back into the case, we couldn't get it to close. Finally, we removed the toenail clippers, and that easily closed the case.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good manicure set, with instruments that I and/or my family members find to be very useful for our particular needs.",1

She is extremely active for her age.  Before the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020, she would go grocery shopping once a week.  During the pandemic, she went as often as three times in one week.  She was always concerned about us not having enough to eat.  Mom, who is vain, also wears a lot of makeup to conceal her true age.  Therefore, she was excited to obtain the 7.8 fluid ounce bottle of Biore' Makeup Remover.  It is a clear oil with a very pleasant scent.  Mom has been using it for two weeks.  She told me that a little goes a very long way.  She gently rubs the oil on her fingertips and then rubs her fingertips all over her face.  Using a Kleenex, she carefully rubs off the makeup and Biore.  She does not like splashing water on her face for fear of splashing water, makeup, and Biore all over the bathroom sink.  She is very OCD about keeping her bathroom and entire house clean.<br /><br />  The Biore efficiently and safely removes Mom's thickly layered makeup.  She hasn't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions from using the Biore.  Her skin is oily like mine.  We don't wrinkle easily.  Both of us look very young for our ages.  Also, I would like to point out that the plastic bottle of Biore arrived with a protector around the nozzle and pump, which is very nice.  The hard plastic protector is transparent.  It easily slips on and off the pump, making it highly reusable.  It protected the Biore against tampering and accidental spillage during shipping.  (The protector covers the nozzle's opening and prevents the pump from operating.)  I highly recommend not throwing the protector away; you may want to do some travelling and take this attractive pink bottle of Biore with you.  My mom and I both recommend the Biore Makeup Remover for removing the thickest layers of makeup.",1

The texture out of the can is at first very creamy, which I thought may affect the holding power, but once I worked in a couple of fingertip sized scoops into my hair, I found that the pomade started to take hold and firm up. My hair held its shape throughout the day and was easy to fix with a comb if needed. When washing it out, despite containing oils and wax, regular shampoo seemed to do the trick. Little to no residue leftover in my hair after a shower.",1

Let's take a look at this ampule.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This is a clear solution that comes out with an eye dropper.<br /><br />HOW TO USE<br />The idea is that you use a toner on your CLEAN face, apply this to the face and neck and chest, and then follow up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />WHAT DOES IT PROMISE TO DO?<br />This promises to lighted dark spots, and add firmness, glow, and hydration.<br /><br />DOES IT DO WHAT IT SAYS?<br />I used this with another Korean toner which is pretty simple, and also the BE PLAIN Aqua moisturizer.  When used, this did not seem to moisturize that much on its own, and for brightness and glow, I would say not over WOW factor after using for a month.<br /><br />DID SKIN LOOK FIRMER?<br />I guess you could say my skin looked a bit firmer, but nothing so dramatic that people said, ""WOW, WHAT ARE YOU USING ON YOUR FACE?""<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This is a scent free, easy to use serum for the face.  It works well with moisturizer, is simple, scent free, and gives a moderate amount of what it says it will do.  It is not remarkable, but it is not terrible either.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FOUR STARS.  This is decent, but not my favorite product at this point.",1

One thing I found extra impressive were the trimmers.  Usually, you need to soak your nails prior to trimming.  If not, they have a tendency to fly off into space, risking eye damage to anyone nearby.  These are so sharp, they just melt through my nail like butter.  I was a little surprised because I've never seen that happen before.  I suspect that'll change as I use them more and more, but it was still impressive to run across that.

At first, my wife thought that these are small and thin, but she found that one was sufficient to remove makeup and mascara, with mascara top coat (which can be challenging to remove with other wipes).  My wife has tried several brands before, including top-rated wipes, and all of them except for this one irritates her skin slightly.  These do not!  Her skin is pretty tough, and she doesn't usually have reactions to cosmetics.<br /><br />There is a label on the inner package with Japanese writing, that's not translated into English on the package.  It says to make sure to use the plastic box to store the wipes to ensure quality and peel off the sticker completely; don't remove the wipes from the bag; make sure to close the lid after use.  I'd suggest that the manufacturer add a translated version on the package.  The package says to use the entire package within 45 days after opening, so if you don't wear make-up every day, you may not finish the package before they start to dry out.<br /><br />My wife loves these!

Bigelow products in the past and have always enjoyed them so I was interested in trying this hand cream. It's very moisturizing! I usually use it after washing my hands or if I wake up in the night with dry hands from air conditioning. It's not so thick that it's hard to get out of the tube, and it's not very greasy, but still feels really good and moisturizing, taking a minute to really absorb. The smell is great! I wasn't really familiar with the scent of quince before. All I knew about it was that it was a fruit. The smell is really nice, I don't even know how to describe it! Subtly fruity, maybe a little spicy too, definitely enjoyable! This is a great product and will last a long time.",1

It has longer and shorter hard bristles along the sides. I'm by no means a beginner with mascara, but for some reason I've poked my eye with this mascara applicator a couple of times already.

You get 5 different kinds of lashes in this set (I personally like the third set the best). Two liners and a tool to help apply the lashes but I don't use it - it's easier to not. However, I do press my real lashes to the fake to make it more inconspicuous. My problem with this set is the liner. For one, its VERY tacky. Even after it dries. My lower lid kept sticking to my upper eyelid any time I'd blink. Secondly, the liner is watery looking when applied. Like it's transparent almost and takes a few coats to get a solid line. Even with the first coat dried, the liner was tacky. The lashes did stay with the liner but I can't get past how tacky the liner is. Thankfully I have some other brand of magnetic liner that I can use with these lashes so this wasn't a complete bust. But kind of defeats the purpose when you buy a set like this. Also, in case you're new to magnetic lashes (well this particular kind) they have like 4-5 really small magnets on the band that adhere to the magnetic liner. You can't see the magnets unless you take the lashes off and show someone. Anyways, I've deducted two stars for the poor liner.",0

I returned those first ones I got and bought these after reading the decent reviews on these. They'll suffice, I guess, but they are by no means the sharpest or best clippers. I actually wouldn't recommend these to a friend. Unless it was a guy friend; these would be okay for guys, but not for pretty girl nails.

So to me that would be a win win situation.<br /><br />It comes in a nice little pump dispenser that works very well. Unfortunately that is where the positive really stops in my eyes. The moisturizer is not too thick and almost runny but it isn't. It is very tinted so it kept up on that promise. I did NOT like the smell of it at all and that scent actually does linger while you apply it and some time after so that was definitely a bit no no in my eyes.<br /><br />The applying of the moisturizer was not very pleasant since it was very sticky in my eyes. Distributing it evenly on my face took some actual work and I just didn't like that. IT was not like most moisturizers that just get nicely soaked up by your skin but because of its sticky consistency, which actually reminded me of a foundation, it took a bit. My skin also didn't feel great afterwards and I almost felt like I needed to set it with a setting powder like you would with a foundation. The color of it was also a bit off, some ashen yellowish brown that I found was not very flattering but thankfully it did not add a lot of color to my skin but actually blended into my skin after a little bit and you hardly noticed you added a tinted moisturizer.<br /><br />At least while I was out and about my face was protected from the sun and I did not get sun burnt, so that was the other upside of this moisturizer. But all in all I did not care for the scent of it, the stickiness during application and that it left behind and how it really made my skin look.

I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says, ""medium"" in the product description, which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level, so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle, BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink, with cool undertones. Still, I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in, but it gives me a slight tanned look, ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..<br /><br />This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen, using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays, converts them to heat, then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available, blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great, and it depends on what works best with  your skin.<br /><br />This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious, skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter, jojoba, oilve oil, and vitamin e. It comes out thin, and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round, and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often, sweating it off, etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized, I feel better about keeping it so simple.<br /><br />Again, I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you, then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool, fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast, at all. If your skin is real oily, then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin; seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy, and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.<br /><br />My skin: mid 40s, leans dry, semi sensitive, non-acne Rosacea (redness, visible veins), I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year, and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else, it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot, and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck, then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try, and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).<br /><br />I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new, or think of anything else.",1
AGV2YW5B3SCKG6WV422CIITZOGRQ,B01EK2F1PC,4,2020-06-18 08:47:21.663,Works Beautifully For My Fair Complexion,"Let me start off by saying I am fair skinned so it's hard to find a bronzer that doesn't look so harsh with my complexion. This was offered to me to try in return for an honest review. So, upon first getting this - it was relatively heavy for just a bronzer/highlight. When I got the duo out, I realized why. The packaging that the actual bronzer/highlight is in is made of some heavy glass like material. It's packaged really pretty though.  There's not a lot of product that comes in the container. But, you get a beautiful golden bronzer and a peachy highlight. The bronzer actually looks very natural on my fair skin. It's not harsh or orange. It looks like a natural shadow on my face - granted you apply bronzer with a light hand - anything that's applied heavy will look harsher. I only use bronzer in the hollows of my cheek and jawline. The highlight is subtle but just enough for on top of my cheek bones and my cupids bow. Overall, I love that this duo looks very natural on me and that it goes on lightly - you can achieve a darker bronzer by layering it. I am a little shocked by how pricey this is but the packaging should've been an inclination that this was going to be a rather expensive duo. This works really beautifully for my fair complexion but I'm just not sure I'd pay this price tag for a bronzer/highlight duo..",1

The second positive about these is that it comes with two bottles of the eyeliner which is awesome since you can keep reusing the eyelashes. I will say that these eyelashes are pretty long. I wouldn't say any of them are ""natural"" looking because of the length.

It’s so much easier than applying glue, in my opinion. I did two thin layers of magnetic eyeliner and allowed to dry. It did stick to my upper lid when I moved my eyelids up as I waited for them to dry. Once dry, I used the tweezer to apply the magnet eyelash. Each eyelash has tiny magnetics that adhere to the liner. I was pleasantly surprised that it worked!! The tweezers was not helpful to me for applying, and the second lash I applied with my hands without a problem. Beautiful lashes!! Wore them all day yesterday and wasn’t uncomfortable at all. Didn’t come off in the wind going to dinner. I simply removed with my hands to replace on the storage palette and removed liner with coconut oil. Lashes are glamorous and reusable. LOVE THEM!!!",1

The palette is actually pretty small but I have yet to use up a palette to be honest so this one will still take a while. You get 5 very nice mattes that are very pigmented and blend out nicely. With those you can create very nice base looks. Then you can use the 11 different shimmers to change the looks as you please. Anything from creamy lights to golds to purples. There is a very wide variety that allows you to really change up the look.<br /><br />I made some looks without eye primers and the look lasted all day without any issue.

The SPF 31 is supposed to be great if out in the sun, but this product doesn't really feel like it's absorbed into my face, leaving it shiny.  I don't want it dripping down into my eyes!  If I happen to touch my face it leaves a slick film on the fingers, and I worry about touching anything else and leaving a smudge of the tint.  The moisturizer has an unusual scent when applied, smelling like natural clay.  Maybe that's the Zinc Oxide?  After a while it's not quite as noticeable.  I usually use a same brand moisturizer with SPF 15 and the liquid foundation also SPF 15, and they appear to be much better absorbed into my face.  If this product works for others, that's good.

I was definitely skeptical but it really is as easy as swiping on the magnetic liner and then sticking the lash strip in place.  THAT IS IT!  No fussing, no dropping, no glue, no 2-piece magnet that you can't ever position properly.  Just swipe and stick.  Pretty much foolproof!  I did find them to be a tad heavy on my eyelid but I imagine that is because I'm not used to wearing false lashes (because I could never figure how to get them on properly...haha) and I'm hoping it will get better with time.<br /><br />Ok...now onto the negative.  While these lashes are absolutely amazing, I was appalled to receive a used tube of eyeliner in my pack.  You know the black thread rings that mascara tubes develop after you have removed and inserted the wand a hundred times?  That's exactly what the eyeliner tube looked like.  A 'sealed' package that contained a used product?  Not really sure how that happened.  Luckily, the kit contains 2 tubes of eyeliner so I went against my better judgement and decided to try the tube that was obviously (maybe I should say hopefully) not used.<br /><br />Other than receiving a partially used product, these eyelashes are AMAZING.

This was a perfect shape for me, so I got it.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This has a wood handle for nails or even watercolor painting- it is a nice solid wood handle.  The brush itself is a teardrop shape with a very fine point.  The ferrule is average, nothing WOW, but not awful either.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This brush has a nice pocket in it which absorbs the watercolor when using it.  It will gradually disperse the paint in a nice thin line, but it does make it so I don't have to dip it as constantly as with a narrow brush.  As for smoothness of lines and how it paints, I really like it.  It is great for small areas of paintings.<br /><br />CLEANING<br />I clean this regularly in the same product that I use for cleaning wool when it is time to store it.  It has deterrent to moths in it.  Other than that, I just clean with water most of the time and only use the other stuff when i am going to put it away for any length of time.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this can be used for nails, I prefer it for watercolor.

One thing I am always on the lookout for is a good product to help with the occasional breakout in my T-zone or the god-awful cystic acne that pops up every so often along my chin and jaw. Since my cheeks are on the dry side, I've only used this on my T-zone to deal with some of the stubborn clogged pores there, and so far so good.  I like how the mask warms up a bit to help pores relax (if that's the right word since pores don't actually open or close) and the AHAs help to soften/dissolve the gunk inside the pores so it is easier to remove. Since I've not had to use more moisturizer than normal, this mask hasn't caused any dry or flaky skin. I also didn't leave it on for a full 20 minutes like the directions say you can do, instead opting to wash it off after just 10 (based on my patch test). Between the AHAs and the bentonite clay and the self-warming, I didn't want to push my skin to the point of irritation. The directions also say you can use this up to twice a week, but since I am also using retinol, I will likely keep this mask to once a week.<br /><br />After checking out their main site, I found this line was created by pediatric dermatologist specifically to deal with skin concerns/conditions more specifically associated with those in their early 20’s such as stress breakouts, hormone changes, excess oil, etc., but they also offer products for dry and sensitive skin. I'm in my 40's and still deal with stress breakouts and hormone changes, and it's nice to see a product address the actual causes behind the breakouts rather than only the end result (the breakout itself).<br /><br />The packaging for this product gets its own star. A full set of directions, possible side effects, and ingredient list - all printed in multiple languages - is included in folded pamphlet form along with the product, so no more hanging on to the box 'just in case.'  You also get a little flag shaped card with a positive message printed on it is included. Tacky glued underneath is an information card underneath that says what the product is for, how to use it, what to expect, possible side effects, and a coupon code for either a percentage off or a free product if you decide to purchase directly from their main website.  Additionally, a sample packet of another of Higher Education's products is included for you to try.

Not sure how much is in this, but it states 50% of the product<br /><br />It is even nice to use this when you just want to give your skin a break from other products, or if your skin has been stressed (environmentally), or if your skin is reacting to something and you need a soothing cream to get through until your skin settles down.<br /><br />I usually use it on my face (in winter) or hands all year, but especially lately. While I always wash my hands often, the past few months I have been using commercial anti bacterial soaps which are much more drying than some-- using CICA cream helps keep my hands looking and feeling healthy). SO yeh, I am mostly loving it as a post hand washing cream.<br /><br />Before this one from Village11Factory, there were two other cica products I have used in my life, both a bit pricier.

The difference is usually what else is in it and sometimes a little difference in texture.. This one is the lightest of all that I have tried, leans more gel like. It is nice and light- one I think is nice for summer. I think I prefer my slightly heavier, creamier one (But 3x pricier for same amount) for winter use-- when I need the extra support in cold, skin chapping weather.  OH yeh, this is good stuff for lips too. It isn't a huge tube, so it could be carried in a coat pocket or purse, no problem.",1

I have others that contain 3 times as much and cost half of this one. One word of caution, please keep in mind when you use products containing retinol to use sun blocker and to apply them in the evening since these can make your skin sensitive to sun light.<br /><br />This serum comes in a stunning little plastic squeeze tube looking like upside down pump dispenser. It has a pleasant and mild scent that I really like.<br /><br />The serum is lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. There is some residue for a brief while but that goes away pretty quickly. It leaves you with nice soft skin that is smooth and feels great. All in all I really do like this even though it is a bit more on the expensive side for what you get. My skin does like it though and with the lower concentration of the retinol this may work better for people who are more sensitive to retinol.",1

It contains collagen and hyaluronic acid which are fantastic ingredients for your skin.<br /><br />The cream is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into your skin. It leaves no residue behind, just soft and smooth skin that looks and feels great. You don't need a lot of this moisturizers so this jar should last you a good while.

They're very comfortable; like any false lashes they feel weird at first but after about 15 minutes I forgot they were there & wore them all day with no issues. They stay where you put them, they DO NOT budge until you pull them off. No glue melting or flaking off into my eyes, obviously that's a big benefit! They look super dramatic with pretty minimal effort.<br /><br />I'm a little confused as to why it's best to apply the lashes when the eyeliner is half-dry but still tacky; is there glue built in to the liner as well as magnets? If you need to reposition them, you have to reapply the eyeliner because the lashes pull some of it off. The eyeliner is very wet when you apply, so be careful - you have to shake the tube before application, and when I pulled the brush out, it spewed eyeliner onto the wall (and it was not super easy to remove). So that's the learning curve part, now that I know I'll avoid those pitfalls.<br /><br />The one unavoidable pitfall is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to remove. I used 3 different types of makeup remover & still needed to scrub my eyelids for a good 10 minutes to get all of it. Not great for the eyelid wrinkle situation! I slathered on a lot of pampering eye cream afterward because my lids were a little sore. I guess I'm glad it won't wear off halfway through the day, but geez!<br /><br />Anyway, despite the difficulty removing it, I'm pretty smitten. I used to love wearing false lashes but they were just so much trouble that I gave it up a few years ago. Now I love them again & they're easy!! I want to order all the lashes!",1

It's incredibly convenient and a great way to reduce waste and save money in the long run. Admittedly, it does take some time to get all makeup off but it's worth it in the end and it feels like a nice, warm facial massage. I actually add a few drops of facial wash to the towel and it removes all my makeup, even around my eyes. Good for my sensitive skin and great for the environment. The larger towel can be used to dry your face, or as a body/face towel.  I actually love the larger one for the shower.  Can use it on my face and body with just a few drops of castile soap.  Makes a gentle lather that pampers the skin. I wash all of these towels in a delicates bag with my normal bath towels and then hang to dry.  I know you aren't supposed to wash microfiber with cotton, but I throw caution to the wind and it's worked out fine.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!",1

You can actually start seeing speckles in the areas where the pores have been cleaned out. It was so easy to remove. I used a warm wet cloth and easily wiped it off. My skin was so smooth and so fresh looking. My pores were so clean and clear. They appeared smaller and tighter. I'm really happy with this mask. Now if you look at the photo I uploaded you'll see the expiration date is 9/20 which is only two months away. The directions recommend using once to twice a week. There's no way I'll finish this before it expires. (Just a side note: I also recieved a retinoid cream from the same brand with the same expression date) and I just recieved these products.

AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,B0876L7BWM,5,2020-07-06 19:20:46.762,They Work Great,"These perform very well. I use them to make my own essential oil (EO) bug sprays, after sun sprays, room refreshers, etc. They are small, spray well & don't leak.<br /><br />The small size is great for portability. I take one of my bug spray formulas outside with me for while I work on my farm. Because I only use EO's the effectiveness wears off much faster than synthetic products. I keep the bottle on me to respray as needed. I have a bottle in my purse with a germ fighting blend for when stores are out of the cart wipes. I even made up a bottle of toilet spray. I use peppermint EO for that.<br /><br />The funnel has a very narrow spout making pouring a slow processes but it keeps me from accidentally over filling the bottles. The tube that goes into the bottle is plenty long. It actually curls up in a C on the very bottom of the bottle. You can cut it if you want, but I leave it as is, I think they function better with the long tube. The stickers are a bit of a joke. I can't really fit ""Bug Spray"" on one tiny label. I'd have to write ""BS"" so I write ""Bug"" instead or ""Sun"" for example. It just barely fits.<br /><br />Overall, great little spray bottles that suit my farm girl needs.",1

My feet are relatively smooth but these help keep them in tip top shape. I make sure to soak my feet for 15-20 mins in warm water before putting the booties on. I put a soak on top of each foot and leave them as long as 2 hours before washing them off. Then starting the next night you have to soak your feet 20 mins each night. This jump starts the peeling.

A little goes a long way, just a few drops per leg (or you can add a drop to your regular shave gel). Helps reduce irritation and you can see where you are shaving! I can't live without it. It's better than any foam, gel or lotion on the market. Truly the best shave experience. I have thick hair and dry flaky skin that is prone to itching and sensitivity. I use this bath oil with a cheapie disposable razor and a few drops of body oil after a shower and my legs are silky for days. Literally days. No razor burn, no irritation, no frustration. I prefer unscented products and this is truly unscented--thank you! Please use caution when using oils in the tub, but I haven't had any problems with the tub getting slippery. Only thing I would change in a better bottle with a pump or dropper top. It's easy to use too much. A little goes a long way so if you're hesitant about the price, don't be, because you'll end up spending more in the long run on something cheaper.<br /><br />Also, used this as a body wash after getting a little too much sun today, and my skin was super soothed.

It is like a long rectangle with the corners of the short end joined behind the neck at a diagonal. It is better than nothing but the cut is just off. Maybe if you have an actual barbers chair it works better. I was using a towel as a cape when I cut my husband and kids hair, and this on top of a towel for the lower back (or two of these capes alternating directions so the long part can go in the front and the back) should do a better job than just the towel. The fabric is cheap thin polyester, which gets the job done but is definitely not ""ultra soft silk fiber"" as stated in the description.

This gel absorbed into my skin after about a minute, without leaving behind a sticky or tacky feeling. I’ve used some aloe vera gels that have left me a sticky mess, but not this one.

I was a HUGE fan of the just-add-water cleaning pads that used to be on the market several years ago (not sure if it was Ponds or Oil of Olay that made them), but then those stopped being sold. They were the best for traveling since they were dry until you planned to use them. Like these pads from the SAEM, you never had to worry about leakage in your bag, TSA pulling them, or the pads drying out. Just like those old cleansing pads, these also have a smooth side for cleansing and a textured side for exfoliating.  Unlike those other pads, these have a nifty little pocket to slide over your fingers.<br /><br />The cleanser used is pretty gentle, and the exfoliation aspect comes from the pad's textured side. The cleanser used smells wonderful and does a good job at getting off makeup and dirt. The textured side will exfoliate well enough to remove any flaky skin you may have, but if you suffer from acne and/or congested skin and blackheads, you will still need to use a chemical exfoliator to deal with the gunk down in your pores as this won't deal with that. Unlike pre-moistened cleansing pads and wipes, you will need to rinse your face afterwards with water. The soapy foam comes off completely without any residue that makes your skin feel sticky or oily. In fact, the cleanser the SAEM uses is gentle enough that my face didn't feel dry or tight, just clean.<br /><br />These little pads are also handy to have if you need to do a quick leg shave! If you need to do each full leg, one per each works. If you just need to get from the knee down, one pad should work for both. Get your leg wet, later up one of these pads, quickly wipe the pad of a section of leg, then shave. Repeat, then rinse off your legs. Desperate times, desperate measures, but it works.",1

I worried it would leave behind a sticky feeling, since I could feel it on my arm the whole time it took to dry. But once the gel finally absorbed, I couldn’t feel any residue left behind. I didn’t notice much of any scent either, which is another positive for me.<br /><br />The gel is clear; the plastic bottle is amber colored to help keep light out. I wish the bottle had a flip top or squeeze lid instead of a screw off cap.<br /><br />The list of ingredients is what gives me pause. I’m not sure why sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) would need to be added to the organic aloe leaf juice. The product description mentions “we perfected our serum by enriching with Vitamin E, & Citric Acid for improved nutrient absorption.” I don’t see Vitamin E listed in the ingredients.<br /><br />I will probably end up using this aloe vera gel to make hand sanitizer.

This was the first time I'd ever used any purple conditioner on my blond hair. After using the other brand, I noticed a subtle change to the brassiness in my hair. While I was satisfied with the results, I also assumed it had done all it could do for my hair.  Tonight, I tried WELLUTION Purple Hair Mask (for blonds).  The mask is easy to apply and it distributes nice  and even on my hair. My hair is thick and shoulder length. It didn't take much mask to cover all of my hair. ( I did put extra mask on my roots/scalp area because I do dye my roots) I let the mask sit on my hair for 10 minutes.  It has a nice scent to it that I very much like. I had no issues rinsing the mask from my hair. It rinsed out without issue. It did not cause my hair to look/feel oily or greasy. I was able to comb it without issue and let it air dry.  When my hair was completely dry it looked and felt nice and soft. My natural waves were present without flyaways.  But...I also noticed my hair was FAR less brassy than it had been.  The change was not subtle the way it was with the first brand I'd tried weeks ago.  This was very noticeable. To say that I""m pleased with this mask is an understatement. Its wonderful.  And I WILL continue to use it as needed.  Blonds, if you're dealing with brassy hair, give this mask a try. I hope it works for you as well as it did for me.",1

I was anxious to see if Monikahair's foot peel mask could help.  The process is incredibly easy and requires next to no work.  Prior to starting, I cleaned my feet. ( The lotion for the treatment is already in the socks).  I then placed a plastic 'sock' over each foot and used the tape on each sock to seal them closed.  The instructions say to keep the socks on for 60-90 minutes but I got wrapped up in an episode of 90 Day Fiance and kept them on for 2 hours. lol. The lotion did not cause any issues for me...I have extremely sensitive skin and had no reaction of any kind to the lotion. It did not cause burning/itching, etc.  When the time was up, I removed the socks and cleaned my feet.<br /><br />Here's what happened:<br /><br />Day 1 (the day after I did the treatment)-nothing<br /><br />Day 2-VERY light peeling-more like little 'threads' of skin<br /><br />Day 3-Actual peeling -I was pulling some decent pieces of skin off of both feet<br /><br />Day 4-WOW...BIG pieces of peeling skin! (unfortunately, I had already started to peel off the skin when I remembered to take a picture for this review...the picture does not show just how much peeling had actually taken place)<br /><br />Day 5-Very little peeling-mainly on toes<br /><br />Day 6-Next to no peeling<br /><br />Day 7 & 8-No peeling at all<br /><br />Results:<br /><br />The bottom of my feet are soft and pink with the exception of my heels. Those are my trouble areas. Calluses are very thick and cracked on my heels.  (a million times worse during winter months!) I DID have some progress on my heels but nowhere near the rest of my feet.  I used the scraper (? not sure if that's what it's called) and made a bit of progress.  I wish now that i had wiped some of the lotion directly on my heels when I wore the socks.  When I do my next treatment, I will absolutely rub some lotion directly on my heels when I start.  I'm impressed and thrilled with the results.  Its flip flop season and my feet aren't always pretty to look at.  This foot peel really helped.  I absolutely recommend Monikahair foot peel if your feet are dry and cracked. They're going to look and feel SO much better after using this treatment!

Also, do be aware that all instructions/ingredients are in Chinese so you’ll have to reference the instructions here on amazon. But once you reference them once, you won’t have to again.",1

I have always had issue with lotions and creams in jars, just from a contamination perspective.  These are a pretty decent size.  They were a little challenging to fill so I had to use popsicle stick/tongue depressor to scrap the lotion from the jar into a Ziploc bag.  Then from the Ziploc bag squeeze it into the bottle like you would squeezing icing from a pastry bag.  These would be excellent to use for travel as well.

Well here we are in a pandemic wearing face masks. Someone came up with the idea of a head band with buttons to hold the mask mask in place.<br /><br />This is a thin material. Think very thin t shirt type material. The headband measures about 18 inches and just over 3 inches wide. I like the material for a headband. However, its use as a mask holder is iffy. Many people complain that the elastic that holds the masks in place makes their ears pop out. That is definitely true of some masks. They can also be wearying on the ears, having that elastic against your ears all day, so this headband is a great concept.<br />I put the headband on and as I stretched it over my head, I heard a pop, so some stitching gave somewhere.<br /><br />I attached two types of masks, one at a time. First, it was a bit fiddly to get the elastic over the button. Once it just sprang off.<br /><br />One mask using the buttons fit well. Another did not. The latter mask opened up on the sides.<br /><br />I would hesitate to wear this out thinking that everything would stay put for hours. I like the headband as a headband. It's nice material. A sort of light grey merle, but if you are looking at this for long-term safety, I would say no.",0

While they work, my hair did get snagged pretty often or tangled in these so I’m not sure if I’ll use them again.

It's not a huge deal for me but just something to be aware of. I love the hat and cold functions which makes it really nice to set your hair at the end and seal in the style. If you've only ever used regular hair dryers you'll really appreciate this added feature. It's a pretty substantial hair dryer. If you're used to really inexpensive lightweight ones you'll notice the additional weight however it's not so heavy that your arm will get tired even if you have a ton of hair like I do.

It looks like a tube of mascara and you use the brush to smooth down your flyaways. It really works! It is very easy to apply.

Promising to dry long thick hair in 10min is a little silly.  My daughter has a med amount of thin fine hair.  Her hair was mostly dry and it took 10min to finish it off.  That actually is longer than it normally takes.  it is also a little awkward to hold- it is just a bit top heavy.<br /><br />Why do I still like it?  It is on the quieter side for a 2000watt dryer.

The issue is when the weather is very dry over a few days' time, my hair goes flat.  Curly hair curls a LOT in humid weather; hence, the frizz which we deal with!  Anyway, I saw these and thought that maybe during those really dry winter days these would assist me in getting my hair to curl as it should.  Now, the problem is, curly hair ""fights"" with some hair items - from my younger years my sisters used bristle curlers (they had straight hair) but the first time I tried using them, my hair like BIT INTO those bristles and man, I nearly had to cut my hair off to get those demon curlers out of my hair!  These are similar, apparently to the bristle, demon curlers as they grabbed a hold of my wet hair and when I tried to pull one off, even holding onto the hair at my scalp, I could feel the tube holding onto my hair for dear life.  That was with WET hair...I'm glad I did not wait for my hair to dry before attempting to pull the tube off!  I have several friends with longer, straight hair and I'm sure they will have a different, happier and more comfortable experience than I did.  What I'm saying is that I'm sure they work - for those with straight hair.  If you have curly hair, best be careful when using them!",0

It's a weaker concentration of retinol but with that trade, you get a less harsh serum that still keeps your skin hydrated and has a lesser chance of causing irritation. You can most likely use this as a serum/cream combo. Likely a big bonus for those with sensitive skin.<br /><br />I've taken a break from my usual Tretinoin cream due to the extreme sun in my area but I do still need to keep up with chemical exfoliants and retinol has the added bonus of fighting acne like Tret does. My skin is definitely smoothing out again and looks more even, but it's a very very subtle improvement so I'm not sure if those that have significant texture issues or need a lot of brightening or fading will be pleased with this as it most likely would take a while to see visible results.<br /><br />It's not a bad product but with such a low retinol percentage it is quite expensive compared to other retinol serums/creams on the market and also comes in a small bottle. I do like it but I don't think it's something I'd purchase myself if only because of that.",0

And yes, it is made in China. Not, ""made for USA but made in China"", but it is a Chinese beauty product. No idea if its been around, how it ranks with beauties on that side of the world. Couldn't tell you the ingredients. Tried translating, but I repeatedly failed. Search engines insisted that I was looking for CPAP not CPCP.<br /><br />So, I usually end up with more mascara that I DONT like rather than what I DO like. I LIKE THIS.<br /><br />Why?  Because my eyes are super sensitive to make up, and this doesn't bother me. AT ALL. I love mascara, but often find myself needing to wash it off after a couple of hours (if not immediately, depending on the brand). No joke. It sucks.  So when I encounter a mascara that..well.. allows me to actually wear it- I add to my list of potential repurchase. I have tried so many over the years. Funny thing, a few on my list happen to be cheap mascara (Essie, Wet-n' Wild,), --but not all-- and most mid level priced brands bother me as well as uber expensive ""natural, healthy"" brands. What I have noticed is that the WATERPROOF brands do the best in terms of feeling gentle and non irritating (probably less likely to flake). Next up, is the most recent generation of mascara that includes ""4D silk fiber lashes"", which this is.<br /><br />The 4D Silk Fiber Mascara is so very different in feel and performance over traditional mascara. It has this interesting ability to coat the lashes- like a black body suit is being painted onto each lash. It easily and instantly really darkens the lashes, and can add volume and length. The formulas tend to be waterproof, and yet somehow wash off much much much easier than typical waterproof formulas. So for me, from application through face washing, the 4 D silk mascara is much easier and gentler to work with.<br /><br />My lashes do not look like how they have it portrayed in the pics. If you already have long lashes, I imagine this will be extra glamorous on you. For me, with my mediocre lashes that simply need a boost of color to make me happy (and not make me want to claw my eyes out)- this works well on me. I included several pics. 3 with one eye with it on, one eye with it off. Then I followed up with 3 pics of the mascara on both.<br /><br />It shouldn't matter, but the box is super pretty. I still have it, and I have no use for it, but it is just so pretty to look at. Added a picture of the mascara wand.<br /><br />If I can glean any further information about this product, I will come back and add to this review.",1

I've only tried it once and it stayed put for 24 hrs, even though a shower! Now that's what I call really waterproof! I don't normally sleep in makeup of any kind but wanted to give it an ""all night"" durability test. Woke up the next morning....was still there! Expected at least some ""mascara"" marks on my pillowcase but there was nary a mark. But my biggest surprise came when I awoke without ""racoon eyes""!!! I usually wear ""tubing"" mascaras as other formulas end up under my eyes within a few hours, I actually expected this mascara to do the same.<br /><br />Volume and length? It definitely added length.  I use Latisse so my lashes have stayed long as I've aged and this mascara provided additional length.  As to volume,  not so much.  However, I only used one coat so it may indeed give the volume advertised with another coat. I really did not notice any ""fibers"" and being a lens wearer perhaps that's not a bad thing.  The formula is not thick so it applies smoothly without leaving clumps. It was fairly easy to remove  with a cotton pad soaked in micro-cellular water.  All in all, if you are looking for staying power this mascara is worthy of a try.<br /><br />The packaging is unique! Hans Holbein's portrait of a young Princess Elizabeth [later Queen Elizabeth I] just caught my eye. I found the square shape vs round tube a lot easier to hold and the brush is a standard design found on many other mascara brands.",1

The packaging is very nice and it includes everything you could possibly need to get salon quality nails. It includes the polish itself, the nails, an Emory board and more. I like the look of natural, subtle colors so I was happy with the choices it came with. The gel itself goes on very smooth and once I applied the nails, they felt strong and held up well. It’s definitely a game changer it’s nice that My girlfriend won’t be going back to the nail salon any time soon.",1

However when I opened it and used the eyelash curler I was very impressed. The curler worked quickly and easily , it was comfortable and easy to use- my lashes curled well with one squeeze. It comes with two extra pads for the curler.  The mascara wand is small and is able to get every lash. I was told the mascara makes my lashes look very natural-  of clumpy. The mascara really lengthened my lashes.",1

I'm so proud of the manicure I was able to give myself the included forms make it super easy.  Putting my gems on was actually harder than doing my set.  The only negative I could possibly give is the included samples of their sticker forms in with the booklet but there is only 4 lol I would suggest having 10 for someone to try.  These aren't included in listing just a free little bonus so can't deduct a star.  Kit included absolutely everything you could need except lamp I'm very happy with it.",1
AEZP6Z2C5AVQDZAJECQYZWQRNG3Q,B00O2FGBJS,3,2020-07-25 20:57:18.513,"Overpriced, doesn't smell like argan oil and to me just about average",This Argan oil is just above around in my eyes. For the $13 you get a fairly small amount of this oil in my eyes. I know Argan oil is not cheap but this does seem a bit overpriced. I am used to argan oil having a pleasant scent but this one was a complete let down and was borderline not pleasant.<br /><br />When you use the oil and apply it to your skin it is pretty lightweight so that statement is correct. It does feel nice on your skin and absorbs pretty quickly but does leave a slight oily feel behind for a short time and that does disappear. At that point my skin felt nice but there are other products I have that make my skin feel a lot better to be honest and give it an amazing smell to boot. So keeping all this in mind I find this just around average.,0

Unfortunately this one and one other product I received expire in less than two months from when I recieved them. I have pretty nice skin because I take very good care of it. So for me 0.5% retinol is just right. It doesn't irritate my skin or dry it out which is always a concern of mine when I use any type of retinol product. This is a nice serum consistency. My skin looks healthier and brighter. It didn't cause me any redness, which can be a problem for me, nor did it cause any irritation. I recommend giving this a try along with some of their other products. Just keep in mind when ordering that a couple of products I recieved to review were very close to expiration.",1

With the Allez outdoor cleansing cloths I would say that your problems are solved!<br /><br />The individually packed cloths fold out to a large size and retains moisture while being used heavily. I've used one wipe to clean my face, arms, legs, and back and there's still a good portion of moisture left on the wipe. In addition, with a nice scent to the wipe you feel really refreshed and clean after using them which is an amazing plus. I would say the best thing about these cloths compared to others is that they are well made and don't break apart after using them vigorously.<br /><br />Overall, going hiking and staying outdoors this item should become an essential item in your pack!",1

I have experimented with DIY acrylic nails. This kit is by far the EASIEST and most USER FRIENDLY kit I have ever used to get longer, stronger nails. This is my new favorite way to do my nails!<br /><br />I have listed pictures of my results using this kit and as a first time poly gel nail user, the results speak for themself. I followed the directions given with the kit with no issue, and I didn't even need to paint my nails with the gel polishes in the kit -- I was already in love with the transparent rosy color of the poly gel!<br /><br />My favorite part is that curing the nail under the mini UV light (which is SO cute btw!) will pretty much dry and harden the nail IMMEDIATELY. I LOVE that there is no wait time to dry my nails. I can do both of my hands within an hour and then go ahead and do whatever I need to do, without any fear of ruining my new manicure.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about getting this kit, then I would definitely recommend taking the leap and trying it -- this kit has everything you need and will definitely give you many, many manicures with just $25.",1

Base notes are described as cocoa, vanilla and tonka.  I can slightly smell the vanilla and bergamot...the others I’m not so good at that.<br /><br />It has pretty good longevity and dries down to a ""warm"" fragrance.

Leave on for 60-90 minutes then wash off.<br />*The box says that it should take 1-2 days for peeling to start but my personal experience was that it took 3-4 days for the peeling to start.<br />*At $11.99 for two pairs (you can use the product up to once a month) it's a good deal.<br />*The adhesive did not stick well for me so I put my own socks over the booties and they stayed on fine.<br />*Once the peeling is done my feet are significantly softer and smoother.",1

I’ve been suffering in vain all this years! This babies are amazing!!! I’m blown away! They are so easy to apply (I have ruined a several looks because of lash application) and this time it took me 5 minutes.<br />Make sure you shake the bottle before each application.<br />If you want a cat eye look you could use your favorite eyeliner And do your cat eye as normal THEN you apply this liquid eyeliner as close to your lash line as posible and last put your lashes on top.<br /><br /> I say this because drawing a perfect cat eye is very hard after you put your lashes unless you are well versed in liquid eyeliner then no problem but in my case, next time I’ll do it the other way around and I’m sure it will be less than 5 min application.<br />Just make yourself a favor and get this magnetic lashes!<br /><br />Update: I’ve been wearing them pretty often and these babes are holding up, I like they don’t get the build up of a glued eyelash!

I’m usually not into these celebrity perfumes but the bottle was super pretty so I was hoping the scent would be just as nice.. not. It smells very much like an elderly home, in my opinion. I think it’d be more pleasant if it’s base notes were more of the predominant scent. But this just is a no go for me. I sprayed it on my forearm, rubbed it in a little and waited a few minutes. Still smelled elderly but a little more spicy. I can’t recommend the scent to anyone. The bottle however - it’s a beautiful decor piece so for that alone is why I’m keeping it and giving it two stars.",0

I use these for my daughter's hair which is very fine and they stay in all day so that is great.  I will say that they are bigger and stretchier than the ones we had before and they do stretch out after one use. I don't think I will reuse the bands much. We haven't had any break yet but I can see them breaking if reused a lot. All in all these work for us and are a good price.,1

Enter this electric trimmer.  First of all, it comes with a number of attachments which seems great.  However upon further use it seems that it's just not great at shaving things, especially when the facial hair trimmer is attached.  I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as a blade but I wasn't expecting to be left with full patches of stubble visible when I ran it over my face.  As much as I wanted to like this, it's just not a great performer for the face. The other attachments work ok, but due to the size of the razor, it's not like it's the best option for detailing work.  It's ok, just not for your face.",0

I do wish there were two hooks so that the person you are putting these in their hair can load the next curlier.<br /><br />That being said, I used this on on daughter who has should length very straight, another whos hair is past her shoulders and has a wave, and myself with a longer Pixi with curly hair. I also experiment with using foam rollers on half our hair, and these on the other half. All this with just damp hair, without products.<br /><br />These curlers by far on all our heads had the best curlers and their curls lasted the longest.<br /><br />None of us had issues with the curlers staying in, nor with the curlers not holding in all our hair.<br /><br />We haven't slept in them since we are going anywhere right now with COVID. But we have enjoyed putting these in our hairs in the morning and taking them out an hour to a few hours later.<br /><br />These will definitely be more go to curlers when I have any events I need to go to, or just want more uniform curls than my natural ones.",1

These magnetic lashes + the eyeliner are STRONG! I've attached photos of the lashes after wearing them for 10 hours at my workplace. The magnetic lashes and the liner are so strong in fact, that I actually ripped out a lash because I accidentally had the magnetic liner on my lash!<br /><br />I'm very impressed by how well it stuck onto my eye throughout the day. I am also VERY surprised of the formula of the eyeliner. I have tried many, many waterproof, smudgeproof eyeliners, but this eyeliner is by far THE MOST waterproof and smudgeproof! I have oily eyelids and my original waterproof eyeliner would still smear on my lower lids (I bought a waterproof Missha eyeliner for $27 and it still smudges!)<br /><br />Not only that, the liner will also remove very easily with micellar water or makeup removing face wash -- it washes off so clean that I don't have to follow up with another makeup wipe after the shower. This is amazing!<br /><br />I only really took off 1 star for three reasons:<br />1) The formula of the eyeliner has a scent that is very perfume-y/chemical-y. This doesn't bother me too much, but I do think that some customers may be bothered by it.<br />2) The brush of the eyeliner is very flimsy -- it is difficult to get a sharp line, because the brush is so thin.<br />3) the inner corners of my lashes began to curl up and off my lash line, pulling some eyeliner with it (leaving gaps in my liner).<br /><br />Overall, I really like this small kit!

Last year my husband and son were in a fishing tournament and had forgotten to put on sunscreen. By the end of the day they both came home really burnt. My son got it really bad on his face and nose.  So I went to Walmart to buy something to help give them some relief. Everything was pretty much sold out  except one really small tube of the SunBurnt Gel. I almost didn't buy it because it was kind of pricey and pretty small. I decided though to give it a try since it was my only option. I put it on both my husband and son and immediately they felt a huge relief from the pain. They said the gel instantly took the heat out of the burn and cooled it down. Then by the next morning I was so shocked to see that they both looked like they never even got burned at all and neither of them were in pain. A few days later my son did start to peel a little on his face. So I used the rest of the sun burnt gel and it actually took the peeling away. His face looked normal again within minutes and didn't  peel again after that. My husband didn't even peel at all. I was thinking maybe we just got lucky because there was no way this product had those results in one day, but I found out this year that it definitely was the sunburnt gel that helped. This year, right before summer I found this one for a great deal. I remembered paying alot last year. I also wanted to try it again, so I decided to buy it and store it away until I needed it. Well last weekend my husband went fishing and forgot to put sunscreen on again. He came home burnt pretty bad. So we tried sunburnt gel again and the same thing as last year happened. By the next morning it was a huge improvement. This time he had to put it on twice, but we are still so amazed with how well this stuff works. For now on this is the only after sun care product that my family and I will buy.",1

It is light weight, but yet it still feels durable and well made. I love the cord length, long enough but not too long. I love how wide the plate is! love that the handle is scissor style - this allows you to apply ample pressure, without r hand cramping or getting tired.<br /><br />I love the results I got with this straightener. My hair is naturally very very curly and super course. My end result with this straightener is sleek and shiny!

It was very hard and crusty at the bottom because he would stand on his feet all night while he worked. My Dad still is a man's man.. He's relaxed in his old age but that's the site I have of him.<br /><br />When he took his socks off, you could see the hardened skin and callouses..  This would have worked WONDERS for him.  Ever since I've always been mindful to take care of my feet. I clip my nails regularly, I do not wear super tight shoes or socks where air can't get through to my feet. This callous remover kit will add another step in foot care.<br /><br />It arrived and I immediately opened it.. I followed the direction and now my feet feel even softer than before.

I charged it several hours before using it, but it began lagging quickly.  I plugged it in and kept using it and didn't notice much difference while plugged in.  The description recommend only use 2 or 3 seconds at a time but I didn't find any reason why it would say that.  It wasn't very powerful, but I did see a considerable amount of very fine skin.  It didn't collect in the little tray that I could tell.  It claims to work wet or dry.  I will leave the wet testing to someone with less candles on their cake than I.  My feet felt better after using.<br />I believe there are better ones than this at a competitive price point.  It did work so I have to give it at least 3 ☆☆☆.  It was quiet so that's a plus.

It is not too expensive since it is less than $40 which is great. When I got it and sprayed it on I had instant flashbacks of another perfume that I really like. It is very reminiscent of LouLou and when I looked up the fragrance profile for both there is a lot of overlap of the similar top, heart and base notes.<br /><br />I found that this one in comparison is a bit less heavy though and not as overpowering. It has a very oriental kind of scent though and I do really like it, ask LouLou, since it is standing right next to it on my perfume shelf. I figured that was the proper space for it. This one does have a hint of lightness though that LouLou does not. It does last quite a bit and does not just disappear after a few hours which is nice.<br /><br />The bottle is very cute and oh so Shakira in my eyes. It is perfect for teens if you ask me but I have no problem putting that on my shelf either. So to keep the comparison going, at the same volume it is cheaper than LouLou but if you get the 2.7 Fl Oz you pay the same price as you would for the 1.7 Fl Oz for LouLou so you could get a better deal but even though they are similar there are just different enough that I can smell the difference if I do a blind test.",1

All 10 spray bottles included all the necessary parts, and the stem that draws up liquid was long in each one, none were short and I really appreciated that. You should be able to spray down to the last drop.  I tested mine with rubbing alcohol, for sanitizing my phones. The funnel came in handy for filling the bottle. It made the job so easy! The sprayer does spray a very fine mist. I used it several times to clean some things then left it overnight with the cap on. Next day I tested it again. First off, the cap contained some of the rubbing alcohol inside it, which means the container will leak into the cap standing up. Not necessarily a huge deal breaker, but a negative for me. Holding it in my hand I got the rubbing alcohol on my finger too, so this may waste product just from this. Several drops every 24 hours may not seem like a lot, but if you make your own essential oil room spray then this could be an expensive waste. Lastly, I had an issue with the spray top, the angle is so slight I wasn't sure if I would spray myself in the face of I wasn't wearing eyeglasses. You have to be careful, ensuring you're spraying away from yourself. I did not get any leakage of the alcohol out of the cap, it seemed pretty tight.  It did pool in the cap, didn't run down the bottle.  I did get a rubbing alcohol ring when I set down the cap on my coffee table tho.  Beware of that possibility whatever you use in these bottles.<br />All in all, a nice kit and I give it 4 stars.",1

There wasn't much between my natural lashes and the made up ones. I found that my lashes also clumped together. As far as waterproof? In this dismal time of masks I found that i sweat like crazy with it on. My regular mascara is not water proof and inevitability ended up on my upper cheeks. So I had high hopes for this. The odd thing kid I didn't see any mascara running down my face, but at the end if the day I had very little mascara left on my lashes. Hmm. So thus is my take. If you want a really nice lash curler, this would be a good choice. It comes with three additional pads for future use. The handle is held shut by a removable plastic piece. Why, I'm not sure. For packaging? At any rate it works very well. The mascara? I think of it as emergency makeup.",0

My lashes looked dramatically darker and fuller and I really noticed the difference when I went outside and checked it out in my rearview mirror. I had tested two mascaras on each eye and this one really stood out. I have been wearing it for almost 36 hours and even slept in it.  After rubbing my eyes since the last night, the top lashes held and I didn't wake up with raccoon eyes. however, it does flake a bit. It applied smoothly and since It's not a quick drying mascara so you have a bit of time to tease out the lashes to avoid  any clumping..",1

Is it my absolute favorite? At the time of writing this review, so far, yes!<br /><br />I really like the formula of the eyeliner, it has been one of the smoothest I have tried so far. As for the strength of the adhesiveness of the eyeliner with the lashes, it is super strong! Even the slightest touch of the lash to the eyeliner will have it STUCK! The eyeliner also is very water and smudge proof!<br /><br />I have only taken one star off because the lash band itself can be a little bit irritating for people with small eyelids/monolids. While wearing these lashes, the inner corner of my eyes were feeling a bit irritated because the band was poking the skin. Eventually this made my eye water, and the inner corners of the eyelash were beginning to peel up. I feel that if I readjusted these lashes, or cut some portion off, it would help with the issue.",1

I am by no means an expert, but the poly gel is the only thing that did not work for me.  I could not get it to cure.  Even after the full polish it still felt like it could crumble off at any moment.  I only did by thumbs, pinkies, and ring fingers, and the gel was broken on all of them in a couple of days.

Very unusual and I haven't seen mascaras like this one before which makes it very visually appealing. The wand is silicone or rubbery. The mascara is very black and bold on the lashes (I have brown lashes and it pops in color). The fibers are there, there are very many of them and wand builds on those fibers very very well with every application stroke. There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this mascara. First is the smell of it. It is a very strong / pungent chemical smell that does not smell like your average mascara from a drug or department store. Second, it is made in China. Maybe I am paranoid, but learning a little of how cheap cosmetics are made oversees, the smell reminds me of all the descriptions from those documentaries. On the bright side (aside the smell), my eyes did not sting upon application, the mascara did not shed, and removing it (although it is waterproof) was very easy with regular miscellar water and a cotton pad. Because of the smell, not a product I would purchase again or give as a gift. But overall very pretty and definitely builds the length + volume with the fibers that are part of the mascara.",1

I do NOT understand why the ad, pictures, description or box doesn’t include the size of the item - I find that oddly curious.  They have an interesting scent that I suspect some people may not like.  It is the chaparral scent which can smell a little ‘chemically’.  It isn’t bad but it *is* a somewhat unusual scent. After wiping down the scent does linger for a while, albeit somewhat lighter.  The wipes seem to have a lot of wiping power... it seemed that the moisture just remained as I wiped down most of my body.  They don’t feel any more moist than other wipes do, but it seems that the moisture goes a longer way.

My thumbs and pointer fingers began peeling yesterday because I used them to open up the socks to put my feet in. A pair of booties come attached so you have to carefully cut them apart and then cut them open before you can separate it to put on. You have to make sure there's a cotton like barrier on each side of the booties before you put your foot in. Hence my thumb and pointer fingers peeling. I must say that this peel mask is way more effective than the one I used twice from Walmart. This one works a lot faster than the ones I've used before. I also like the fact that you get two pairs of them and they even include a callus shaver tool. I love the smell of lavender when you open up the mask even before you put them on. There's a tab on the side of the booties to peel and fold over so that the they are securely on your feet. Pretty nice idea considering the last feet mask, I used you had to put socks on over them to make sure 1. I didn't fall while moving around and 2. they don't slip off. The tabs make sure they stay in place and I was able to walk in them with my house shoes on. I wore them for an hour and washed the solution off my feet which were very soft afterwards.

The tube looks like a regular mascara tube and same with the application wand. It glides on very smoothly and I barely ever have to go over the same area more than once. This wand is a little miracle worker and believe you me, I have tried many tactics to get the little baby hairs to stay in place. So far, this is the only thing that has done the trick. What have I done without this my whole life?!",1

I spent more time walking barefoot around the house, and my pedicurist was closed for months.  I decided to trying doing my own pedicure.  I think this Wonder 4 will do a nice job, but it is taking some ""getting used to.""  I had to experiment with the different grinding heads to determine which worked best on my feet.  I think the unit could be a bit more powerful.  But, it does smooth rather quietly.  It just takes a little longer than I expected to receive ""professional-like"" results.  The rechargeable battery makes it very convenient.  It is supposedly for wet or dry use, but I have only tried it dry.  I feel that smoothing would take even longer if I added moisture.",1

AFLKX7ZNVK2DN6LG3EAP6ZNYUFHA,B087FTZSZH,5,2020-07-31 18:46:02.401,Little to No Damage Easy Curls,"I absolutely love hair curl & wave forms. I have used these before but the wave curl form set when I had longer hair. These curl forms are super simple and easy to use! It is important to take small enough sections, but large enough to be able to cover your entire head. Taking too large of sections can create a pulling out of the hair and scalp, so be very careful! This set is the perfect length for my medium to short, shoulder length hair... give or take a few inches depending on whether or not I had a recent trim or not. I usually shower in the morning, but these curl forms definitely work best if you shower at night then dry or air your hair first about 50-80% of the way before using the hook to pull your small-medium sections of hair through. This cuts down on the drying and setting time. I like to put these in my hair before bed then wear a silk hair cap over night. You could also do this after a morning shower and let them dry and set while you do things around the house, but this always tries my patience. You can also use a dryer cap to speed up the process if you do this during the day or your morning routine. These create the perfect little ringlet curls. I always use hair spray, let set for approximately 5 minutes,  then tassel and/or finger comb through my hair after for a more natural curl look. I highly recommend trying these curl formers if you would like to try a little to no damage heat option for your hair!",1

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B08BMV4C42,5,2020-07-31 20:52:17.656,"GReat Bronzer For Medium To Lighter Skin Tones, But Great Eye Shadow Too- Read On","As a makeup artist, I am always trying to find ways to get the most mileage out of the products that I use.  This bronzer had some surprises to it.  Read on..<br /><br />PHOTO- My photo has swatches of both color 1 and 2 which are labeled.  I tried to get accurate photos colorwise and it is hard to do as the camera does not capture the nuances.  When applied with a brush, the effect is MUCH lighter.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />COMPACT<br />The compact is a high layered cardboard with a strong hinge to it.  There is no mirror and the pan inside has the product with designs pressed into it.  It does not come with a brush.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE COLOR LIKE?<br />This color is more of a bronze gold color.  It is still on the cooler side, but light warmer skin tones could use this too.<br /><br />TYPE OF SKIN TESTED ON?<br />This was tested on both MAC translation of skin tones NW 25 (which is what you see in the photos) and NC37 which is a more tan but cooler skin tone.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY?<br />This applies well but you have to be sure you find the right brush.  A stippling brush was the best way to get a natural look from this bronzer and highlighter.  It allows for subtle application so that it does not look like you have on too much.  If you use too dense of a brush, it is easy to get a stripe of glow on your face that others will see and it can really look odd.  You also need to get a fresh brush and blend it very well into your skin.  Apply this in the backwards 3 figure on each side of your face.  Imagine two 3s in a mirror image on your face with the tips and centers touching.<br /><br />ANY OTHER USES?<br />I found that this also makes a fabulous eye shadow.  I found it to be a perfect match with the other color in this series of number 2 which is a darker more rose brown color.  This is a great companion to that.  If this is all you have, It also makes a great eye shadow alone or with another lighter satin finish shadow or even a matte.  I would not go super frosty.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY TO EYES<br />In terms of eyes, you can use this as a contour, all over color, or in combination with the other darker color of this Sungasm series or another set of shadows.  The application is best for a lighter look to use a teardrop shaped brush.  Then for a heavier look with more color, a flat eye shadow brush packing this gently into place over a good eye primer is the way to go.  For a quick application, you can also use a finger to apply and blend it with a brush or your finger<br /><br />ANY IRRITATION PROBLEMS?<br />I am VERY sensitive and did not have any problems with this product on the face or eyes.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />As long as you are willing to take some time to find the right brush for the application of this, this bronzer is a pretty color especially for cooler toned skin.  It is a good highlighter for darker skin tones as a highlighter, though.  This is beautiful on the face, eyes, and in tandem with the other color of this bronzer too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS.  This is a nice bronzer and I am surprised at how well it works on cooler skin tones, something that is not all that easy to find, especially in TWO colors of a collections.",1

This mini system does not come with color, so be prepared.  The packaging is attractive, and the products came very well packaged and arrived safely in perfect condition.  This gel nail polish kit has  a little different texture than some of the kits available these days. This system has a complete nail prep and foundation product line-up much like the really great gel nails from 20 years ago. I'm hoping the long term quality of the nail growth and health with this product line,  is as good as the old products as well. As well all know, products can help your nails or destroy them, and this product line, the formulas remind me of the better products that were once available and were very expensive to buy.<br /><br />The thing people may not be used to is the last step of using the finishing wipe to remove the sticky layer once the manicure is complete. Some top coats are completely set and free of any tackiness right after the curing process. These products cure quickly with some heat, and 60 seconds seemed to be plenty of time. After the top coat and final removal of the tackiness, the nails are perfect. This kit doesn't come with color, so I experimented with a milky white and some blue ink, using the wood tools included in the kit to move and swirl the pigment around. It's a fun, creative way to change  up polish. I think stencils could be fun, and I do have mica powders, some bling pieces, to play with as well. I like these products, and the box came with a nice catalogue of other products available.<br /><br />This product is easy to use, I've experienced no irritation of my cuticles or nail bed, no itching or discomfort at all. The light is really cute, tiny and it works. Just one easy button and it turns off automatically in a minute. I pressed twice to get 2 minutes but found that 1 minute was enough, which is great. The result of this product is thin, but strong, offering flexibility of the nail as well, and no cracking. I'll update with wear and removal.  Very reasonable and competitive value.  5 stars.",1

The brand is known for their use of the grapeseeds from a vineyard and discovering the antioxidants help to combat aging and free radicals.  This kit has some of their more expensive creams in small doses, so you can try the range of creams (Vinoperfect, Premier Cru, Vinosource and the famous Beauty Elixir and Instant Foaming Cleanser.

To me, the eye cream is outstanding -- very moisturizing and soothing, with almost no scent.  I also really like the moisturizing sorbet.  The radiance serum is nice, too, but the size is deceiving, as it actually only contains .33 ounce (as stated on the tube).  So, it feels like the tube is only about 1/2 full. The only product I didn't care for is the ""beauty elixer,"" which is a spray. It is a little sticky and the scent is strong (to me personally, it smells a little like natural bug repellent), too strong to spray on my face.<br /><br />But everyone's tastes are different!

I thought this would be a bigger deal, but most of the time only part of the file is being used as I am working on the tough spots like the heel or edge of the toe. It doesn't have a lot of power and it kind of slows down a lot. But it gets the job done. I like that it is rechargeable as the Amore went through a lot of batteries.",1

I have about half a charge when I got it and it did charge to full less than an hour.<br />Again, my problem is more medical than aesthetic so I'm always looking for a grinder that has a long lifespan.  Because of how the wheel is set up, you only get a use area of 180 degrees.  I like the interchangeable heads on this one.  I have another one with changing heads, but they go on and off.

This scent reminds me so much of Black Orchid that I wondered if it was designed to be similar. I kind of think it is--lots of the ingredients and notes are exactly the same. Except this scent is less overwhelming and less formal, to my nose, so I feel more comfortable wearing it. It's very warm and sexy without being stinky. If I use one spray it doesn't feel like I'm enveloped in it. They're calling it a gourmand fragrance but what I smell is flowers and wood; the foodie notes (vanilla, etc.) are secondary at most. It's a perfect humid summer night scent if you like deep, warm floral fragrances.",1

I love that it comes in a good sized zippered pouch bag so I am able to put my other makeup / skincare products too. The products are all travel sized so this is a great set to bring with you on a weekend getaway. I recommend this set to anyone looking to sample their products before committing to full sized ones.

Polygel is easy to work with because it doesn't harden until you cure it, so you can make sure it's just how you like it. It's easy to use the dual forms included with the set. Comes with some cute colors, base and top coat a few nail art things to experiment with and the little uv light. The gel polish colors have great opacity with 2 coats.

I have the PinkGray color. The gray is a medium shade with a smooth finish that won’t pick up hairs and dust. The pink is a metallic magenta that really pops.<br /><br />The speed controls are on the handle. The slide button doesn’t move easily, so there’s not a big chance of accidentally changing the speed/temperature without meaning to. On the back of the handle is the option for either cool or hot temperature.<br /><br />The hair dryer doesn’t dry my hair any faster than any other hair dryer I’ve used. But I like that I can set the temperature to cool to lessen damage and not have to hold in a cool shot button.<br /><br />The hair dryer isn’t as lightweight as some plastic models I’ve used, but it’s weighted pretty well. The weight of it is distributed evenly on both sides of the handle.<br /><br />The attachments have little tabs that line up with notches on the nozzle, and then you twist them to lock them in place. I like it -- there’s less chance of them popping off while I use the hair dryer.<br /><br />The bottom of the hair dryer says the rated power is 1800 watt, which is contrary to the description which says it is 2000 watt.",1

The little buttons are very secure on the headband and to me don't seem in danger of popping off. The cloth is very soft and firm on the head so it stays in place pretty well through the day and isn't super thick so those in hotter climates won't be sweating through terribly and soaking the band.<br /><br />I'm giving this 5 stars because it DOES do what it's supposed to (stays on the head, secures bands around the buttons, etc) and feels good and soft but sadly my head/face is just too petite for this to work with a mask so I'm having to stick with my children's sized masks or the ones that go around the back of my head to ensure I don't have gapping around my cheeks or chin. The headband does it's job, masks are just too big/wide for me to actually have them work together.<br /><br />So it IS a very good product, it's just not enough to solve my personal issue and that's not a fault of the headband so it would be unfair to rate it poorly because of that. In all likelihood for the vast majority of people, this will work perfectly<br /><br />However, I still use it as a plain headband! I like that it's so firmly in place that I can use it to hold my hair back when I wash my face and do my skincare routine and works great when I'm excercising and don't want a mess of curls flying into my sweaty face. So it's still serving a great purpose for me even if I can't use it with masks!",1

It goes a long way, but at the same time, this is a small tube (3 oz). It dries quickly. And it's the type of mask that makes your face feel TIGHT. The type where you can't smile.<br />After about 20 mins, I washed this off. It was easy to remove. After using a few times, I think it does indeed have a brightening effect on the skin. It doesn't moisturize. At least it didn't for me, and I had to lather on cream afterwards as my skin felt a bit dry after the mask.<br />Overall I liked this. I like how it worked but it is on the pricey side.",1

It does a really great job cleaning and exfoliating my skin. I love the way my skin feels afterwards. It feels very smooth. I do think it's a bit overpriced though, but it definitely does its job!

Other facial scrubs I've tried have coarser particles, so coarse it feels like I'm rubbing sand on my face.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the product I received will expire in less than 3 months - Oct 2020. This doesn't seem to be just a one-time occurrence. I also purchased the  ""Higher Education MBA Night Renewing Serum with 0.5% retinol"". That one expires even sooner - on Sep 2020.<br /><br />I don't know what Amazon's policy is on expiration dates for skin care products. But, if I were purchasing this from a physical store, I wouldn't get something that expires in less than 3 months. I expect a product to be good for at least a year. Granted, expired doesn't automatically mean that a product is unusable. However, customers don't like getting old stock especially when a customer still has to pay full price for it. I didn't it but, if I were, I'd be annoyed enough to return the item.<br /><br />I also don't know if Higher Education regularly sends soon-to-expire items to Amazon or if they're just doing this to Vine purchases. Either way, that's really not good practice. For a facial scrub that costs $25, I don't expect the seller to pass off expiring products on me.<br />UPDATE - After going through reviews of the two Higher Education products, it appears that they regularly send soon-to-expire products to customers. Bad seller - Higher Education. Really really bad.<br /><br />One star for sending me an old product. Amazon, stop selling old products!

This is the secret behind the success of Ipsy and Birchbox. You get five travel sizes of the most popular and bestselling items sold by Caudalie: an eye cream, radiance serum, moisturizing sorbet, foaming cleanser, and beauty elixer. The eye cream was nice but I didn't see any effect on my wrinkles; the radiance serum made my skin feel great, as did the moisturizing sorbet. I think I liked the cleanser the most and the beauty elixer the least (it didn't do much for me). Considering that each one is costly for a full size version, it's great to be able to know which one is right for me before purchasing. To top it off, it comes in a beige canvas cosmetic travel bag decorated with grapes. Very nice.",1

The instructions recommend you replace the head every three to four months. Leuxe offers the replacement brushes at $10 each. You can find others offering 2 brushes for that same price.

Im sort of obsessed with skincare and I have lots of it. Despite what you might think because of my 1 star review, I actually LOVE a lot of Caudalie products. In fact a few of them are staples that I always make sure I have at any given time. So why the one star review you might ask?<br /><br />This set is a complete and total rip off!!! I saw that they had beauty elixir in this and jumped on it without even looking at the sizes. I assumed since it said $106 value these were gonna be at the very least deluxe travel size. No these are legit sample size. Not to mention there radiance serum, Creme sorbet, and premier cru eye cream are terrible. The instant foaming cleanser is ok and I love the beauty elixir but the other 3 are so bad. The eye cream pills like crazy and makes you eyes legit drier. The radiance serum is sticky and does nothing. And the creme sorbet looks like cottage cheese and leave this like film over your face. Also if you apply the eye cream and the serum Sparingly once a day you might get 5 days use out of them. The creme sorbet maybe a week. I actually purchase a few items from Caudalie all the time and I get these 3 crappy samples like almost every time I order for FREE with purchase.<br /><br />So do i recommend this “value” set at $46 bucks? No freaking way.<br />Do I recommend other Caudalie products? Absolutely.<br />Go buy yourself from Caudalie:<br />•The beauty elixer<br />•detox mask<br />•purifying clay mask<br />•moisturizing mask<br />•hand and nail cream<br />•deep cleansing exfoliator<br />•glycolic peel<br />Any of these listed are fantastic products that met or exceeded my expectations and most are staples in my collection that I use all the time.",0

I wear makeup every day and use cotton rounds to remove my makeup which can cost a lot overly time.

I could never get them on right, one would come out better than the other, my eye would almost get glued shut, you name it. I was very interested to see how these would work for the lash challenged person like myself.<br /><br />I have become much better at applying eyeliner over the years, and I will suggest that if you do want to try these, that your eyeliner game be pretty good. The ""eyeliner"" pen is your glue with these. It comes out looking like eyeliner, a black color. You set the lashes on top of the eyeliner after a few seconds, and set them into place. These do come with a tool to help you apply your lashes, but I didn't find it to be all that helpful. My fingers and a pair of tweezers did the job. These did go on fairly easy. My first few times it did take a bit of fixing to get a better fit. Once into place, they seemed to dry really fast and stayed on very well.<br /><br />For someone like me who is lash challenged, these went on easy. Does take a bit of practice, but a lot easier than dealing with regular glue, waiting for it to get tacky, and trying not to make a mess. These are much better and easier in my opinion.",1

I was very pleasantly surprised by this scent....I like dark orientals and even though this is listed as floral gourmand, it fits the bill as a dark oriental for me.  I definitely get the base notes of vanilla, cocoa, tonka and benzoin....it is very reminiscent of a scent I used to wear a long time ago, but can't quite place it?  Maybe Euphoria?  Not sure, but this is a really nice rich dark scent that is heavier on the gourmand side than floral.  This is for sure a date night scent.",1

I tried out the polish and it works awesome! Easy to apply, and dries instantly. I feel like I went to the salon but for so much cheaper! My nails really look great. If I have one complaint it's the the light has to be plugged in to use, its not rechargeable. But overall I am so so pleased with this kit. It's going to be hard to go back to regular polish after this, and the price point makes it hard to justify going to the salon. Highly recommend!",1

However it says it’s designed for men’s thicker skin, but the actual exfoliation is pretty fine. Many women’s exfoliating washes are much more coarse.

AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,B07ZQRX7FX,5,2020-08-06 20:51:28.508,Higher Education NO BRAINER Effectively and Thoroughly Cleanses My Face without Drying It Out!,"Eight months ago, I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee.  The change in environment, I believe, is what contributed to my complexion becoming extremely dry.  In the mornings, I began waking up with red, flaking, irritated, inflamed patches of skin beneath my eyes, at the corners of my nose, and at the sides of my mouth.  After a month of using a very expensive moisturizer four times a day, the patches of damaged skin were eventually healed.  I feared that the patches would reappear after I finished using the high-end moisturizer.  Thankfully, I received the opportunity to review three facial hygiene products from Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser, GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  These are strange names for three products that have worked wonderfully.  I have faithfully used them all every day for three weeks.<br /><br />  Let me say that I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male with a raunchy complexion.  I still get pimples occasionally.  My skin can tend to be oily but if I wash it too much it becomes very dry.  The NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser is one of the few cleansers that actually cleans my face without drying out my skin.  After I use it, my skin still feels soft and supple.  In the mornings, I wash my face with the NO BRAINER before I shave.  Then I take a shower.  Even after I step out of the shower, my face still feels soft and supple, not like a piece of dry leather.  The cleanser tends to add moisture rather than take it away.  Also, I can use it twice a day without worrying about it drying out my skin.  When I first moved to Tennessee, my face became so dry that I could only wash it in the mornings and I could only shave every other day.  Now I am back to washing my face twice a day and shaving every day.  I feel cleaner and more ready to face the world when I am clean shaven every day.  Also, I wake up the next morning with fewer pimples if I am able to wash my face before going to bed.<br /><br />  The green gooey substance in the tube is easy to apply to my face and easy to wash off.  It feels luxuriously pleasant on my face.  The cleanser has a faint, pleasant scent that is neither masculine or feminine.  Neither does it linger after I have used it.  The six fluid-ounce tube was received inside a sturdy cardboard box with company literature inside.  A tabbed piece of gray metallic tin foil covered the tube's nozzle.  This foil was intended to prevent accidental leakage and spillage during shipping and to also serve as a deterrent in case someone wanted to contaminate its contents.  There is an expiration date on the bottom of the box and one on the back of the tube's crimp:  EXP:09/21.  This is an excellent date.  This cleanser should be used up long before then.<br /><br />  Most importantly, I have been using this superb hygiene product for at least three weeks and haven't experienced any allergic reactions such as acne, boils, hives, rashes, etc.  I am very happy with it.  If you are searching for a facial cleanser that is soothing, gentle, and hydrating (it won't dry out your skin), then I highly recommend the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser from Higher Education.",1

This is my first time ever using this kit much less trying to learn to do my own nails. Read the directions a very carefully and actually follow them and make sure you actually do use the alcohol that suggested. I did find it the gel was a little thin or possibly I put too much alcohol to thin it out more I do not too sure. I only gave it four stars considering it was very hard for me to do it and the directions weren't very clear for me. I will try again probably in 2 weeks and I'll probably update this review and add some pictures to see if possibly it was me that did something wrong.,1
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,B07ZS3DKL5,5,2020-08-07 00:23:02.871,This Green Vegetable Crème from Higher Education Makes the Perfect Facial Moisturizer!,"I never realized how important, powerful, and essential green vegetable are for maintaining good health until I used the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I am using this product along with two others that are manufactured by Higher Education:  NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and MBA Night Renewing Serum.  I always use the NO BRAINER prior to using the GOAL DIGGER.  The GOAL DIGGER feels luxuriously soft, soothing, and relaxing as I apply it to my skin.  I use it at least twice a day, in the morning and at night before I retire to bed.  Sometimes, I use it more often, applying it to problem areas of my skin:  beneath my eyes, around the corners of my nose, and around the corners of my mouth.  This cucumber crème is safe to use often because it is made from vegetables that hydrate your skin.  I often saw women putting cucumber slices on their eyes to reduce puffiness.  Now I know that it must work.<br /><br />  When I retired and moved from Virginia to Tennessee, my skin had a difficult time adjusting to the new climate.  Many mornings I woke up with dry patches of red, irritated skin throughout the sensitive triangle of my face where my eyes, nose, and mouth are.  It took about a month of diligently using an expensive high-end moisturizer three and four times a day before the dry, irritated patches of skin went away.  Thanks to the faithful usage of the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, the dry patches have not returned.  The No Brainer gently cleans my face, leaving it moist and supple, not dry.  Then I apply a liberal amount of the Goal Digger.  At night, I also use the MBA Renewing Serum with 0.5% Retinol around my eyes in order to prevent wrinkles.  I am able to use the MBA every night without it aggravating my skin.  I've noticed a difference since I've been using this product.  All three Higher Education products (the NO BRAINER, the GOAL DIGGER, and the MBA) have worked very well for me.  I highly recommend that they be used together in order to maintain healthy, attractive skin.  I am a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male.  Friends and relatives tell me that I look much younger than fifty-six.  Many believe that I am still in my forties.<br /><br />  The GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème can be found in a large, flat jar made of very hard plastic that is blue.  It has an easy-to-remove screw-off/screw-on lid.  When I first opened the jar, I found a hard cardboard, tabbed protective seal beneath the cap.  This seal prevented accidental spillage and leakage during shipping and also served as a deterrent against harmful tampering.  An expiration date is provided on the bottom of the sturdy, cardboard box in which the jar was packed and it is also faintly stamped on the bottom of the jar itself.  The expiration date is as follows:  EXP: 09/21.  This is the same expiration date that was also on the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser.  The two products are meant to be used together.  09/21 is a good date.  Both products will be long gone before then.<br /><br />  If you are searching for a moisturizer that will prevent dry, irritated patches of skin from appearing overnight on your face, then I highly recommend that you use the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème from Higher Education.  I've been using it for three weeks and have not experienced any ill side effects such as acne, hives, blisters, etc.  I seriously doubt that you will since it is made primarily of vegetables.  Our moms always said vegetables were good for us.  Whenever I use the GOAL DIGGER, I feel that I am playing with my green vegetables.  Using it is fun.",1
AH36N5HJJQCBDAURJUTFAIB4GRFA,B07MN1KJ15,4,2020-08-07 02:20:01.814,MBA Night Renewing Serum Helps Reduce the Appearance of Wrinkles Around My Eyes!,"No, I'm not vain, but I don't won't to look old before my time.  I'm a fifty-six-year-old Caucasian male who just retired after 34 years of government service.  Fortunately, I still look as though I am in my forties.  What is my secret?  Simple.  I don't smoke, I don't lay out in the sun, I drink plenty of water, and I moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Lately, I've also learned the importance of using products, such as facial serums, that have retinol, which reduces wrinkles around the eyes.  I don't believe in plastic surgery but I do strongly believe in using topical products that reduce the appearance of aging.  Everyone I personally know who has had plastic surgery ended up looking like a clown with a lopsided mouth and huge, shocked eyes.<br /><br />  I've been using several Higher Education products as part of a facial cleansing and healing regimen.  The products that I've been using are the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème.  Both are excellent products; I am quite pleased with them.  Thanks to them, my skin looks healthy and glowing.  After I retired, I moved from Virginia to Tennessee and the change in environment caused my face to become badly dehydrated.  I was waking up with dry, irritated patches of skin on my face that sometimes stung.  Thankfully, with the help of the Higher Education products, I have been able to heal my skin and keep the dry patches away.<br /><br />  I also decided to use the MBA Night Renewing Serum from Higher Education as part of my nightly ritual.  The MBA is to be used only at night.  Also, the consumer is to use it only twice a week and gradually increase its usage as tolerated.  Well, I've been using it every night for two weeks without any issues.  However, I use it sparingly around my eyes.  I've noticed a difference in the three weeks that I have been using it.  Fewer wrinkles and smoother skin.  The serum is light-green and doesn't have a distinguishable scent.  It burns slightly when I put it on but the burning sensation quickly goes away.  I use the MBA after applying my GOAL DIGGER, which moisturizes my skin, preparing it for the MBA.  Like I stated earlier, I've been using the MBA for three weeks and I haven't experienced any ill side effects or allergic reactions such as acne, hives, blisters, or red, swollen skin.<br /><br />  The serum arrived in a 1.7 fluid-ounce pump bottle with a plastic, transparent cap.  For some unknown reason, I keep forgetting that the tube has a pump.  I want to squeeze the tube as though it were toothpaste.  The cap prevents accidental leakage and spillage.  I think it would be difficult to tamper with the tube.  The tube arrived inside a sturdy, cardboard box, which contained company literature.  The MBA is a good product.  My only issue with it is the expiration date.  An expiration date is provided on the back of the tube's crimp and on the bottom of the box.  It reads as follows:  EXP 09/20.  This is not a good date, especially for a product that will probably be in usage for three to four months, if used sparingly.  I expected it have about the same expiration date as the one I found for the NO BRAINER Gentle Skin Cleanser and the GOAL DIGGER Moisturizing Cucumber Crème, which is 09/21.<br /><br />  I wonder if Higher Education decided that giving products that would soon expire to reviewers from the Amazon Vine Program was a good means for disposing of aging products.  Whenever I review a food or hygiene product, I always look for an expiration date.  Not all hygiene products have expiration dates.  I think they all should in order to let consumers know whether or not they are receiving safe products with fresh ingredients.  I hope that customers who actually purchase the MBA Night Renewing Serum will obtain a product with a better expiration date.  Nevertheless, I believe that MBA is good for lessening the appearance of wrinkles.  MBA won't remove them completely.  I don't think anything will.  However, MBA will help to minimize them.",1

Be careful when you dab the water onto the cotton pad as it can pour out. Though the product is described as a no-rinse cleanser, I would recommed washing your face after using the cleansing water. I worked out after removing my make-up with the cleanser but the product got in my eyes and it irritated them like when soap gets in your eyes.

I use a mask every day, especially during this pandemic while I am stuck at home & not able to go to a cosmetologist for a facial. I have aged & have dry skin with lots of fine wrinkles appearing around the corners of my eyes and a deep nasolabial fold forming. I am saddened every time Iook at my reflection in the mirror. I absolutely love this 2-step product. I opened one end of the product & applied the small masks to my eyes & around my mouth (4 to a pack) and then applied the whole face mask (step 2) over it all. I left them all on according to the directions and my face felt amazing afterwards. I was so pleased with the way my face felt that I was already looking forward to the next time I used this product. Btw, my face is very sensitive to skin care products & this particular product did not cause me any redness, irritation,  peeling or burning.

It comes well packaged and has a nice variety of bits.  The enclosed instructional booklet explains the uses of some of the bits but not all (still don’t know the use of the pink triangular cone one). This drill is great for use on acrylics, gel, dip and (carefully) on natural nails.  The drill does come with a power cord but not a power block/brick so you will need to plug this into a usb outlet or brick to use it.  The cord has a dial that adjusts the speed.  There is also a switch where you can choose which direction you wish the file to spin.  The bits are very easy to insert and remove from the drill.  Great tool!",1

I didn't know what that little metal-tined thing (photo 2) was for.  I figured it was a mustache comb and I have a mustache so I gave it a try.  Worked great!  The little tines penetrated the mustache hairs and felt great on the underlying skin.  Kinda like an exfoliater!  I loved it.  Couldn't find a description of it on the product's page so I reviewed a couple of similar products and discovered that it's actually for cleaning the brush.

Then I compared them to the other headbands I got, this one is short of about an inch on both sides for its largest size. The quality also differs from one another, some are really well made, some are loosely fitted and not well attached. The headband is wrapped with silk black lining and topped with colorful knotted cloth of velvet and chiffon materials.

I just had a lash lift done, so I barely have to curl my lashes but on days when I don't wash my lashes, this really helps mine add some nice curl to my lift. I like that the curler came with 3 soft pads, so I can replace as needed. Mine usually last a while so I'll be good for quite some time! I also really like this mascara. I am pretty picky when it comes to mascara because I already have fairly long lashes. I look for mascaras that add volume rather than length and this one does not disappoint. The mascara wand makes application a breeze. It is super easy to apply and wears all day long without having to reapply. A definite duo to add to any makeup lover's collection!",1

I am not a beginner, but I was excited to have everything in a tiny package- something easy to pull out with friends but with high quality results.<br /><br />I got a friend, we opened the box and assumed I'd be ready to do her nails without getting my nail kit.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />The first sept (as it always is) was to clean buff and shape the nail- nothing included to do that.<br /><br />I thought- okay- no big deal.<br /><br />I got my stuff out and took care of it. I then applied their prep product- Nail dehydrator- all good.<br /><br />I started to plug in the nail light, so I’d be ready after we apply the first coat- but this kit didn't include a plug- just a usb cord. (sigh) I got up again- and got an extra usb plug I had. Now slightly annoyed because this is supposed to be a ready kit-<br /><br />but hey-- really-- not a huge deal.<br /><br />Then I applied the base coat. Whew- runny. I wasn’t impressed with it’s consentaneity. But maybe it’d perform well?<br /><br />Then I tried to cure it. Cue the light--<br /><br />Oh, my word their nail lamp is horrible.<br /><br />It’s very cheap looking- only fits four fingers- not the thumb at the same time, and really feels off- like the break into shards plastic, not the bendy kind. (I was still trying to accept this as a no big deal point but the red flags were slapping me in the face.)<br /><br />I read the pamphlet to see how long it needed to cure- the pamphlet said ""cure for the appropriate time"" or something just a vague. I read the nail polish, to find the appropriate time- nope. I looed over the box- nothing.<br /><br />We used the lamp like 5 times and finally got her base coat cured. Then we had to do the same with just her thumb. I have nail lights that cost three bucks that work better than this thing. I’m not kidding.  In fact- I use single nail lights that only cure one nail at a time—and this was SLOWER!<br /><br />Okay- that was over.<br /><br />Where is the red polish?<br /><br />The box says: “Step two apply polish” and it has a picture of the polish- a red polish, they name it like it’s included.<br /><br />It’s not.<br /><br />This starter kit isn’t much of a START without a polish-<br /><br />but Okay- my nail kit to save the day.<br /><br />I pulled out a blush pink gel that always does me right.<br /><br />But the base coat is weird. The polish is almost clumping on the nail. It applies a tad bit patchy. I get that not all formulas work together—but they DIDN’T GIVE ME a polish to work with so theirs- in theory- should be mostly universal. I didn’t know I was intended to buy-one polishe- AND their kit to make this happen.<br /><br />I try to cure MY gel polish tin their lamp.<br />(thank goodness my friend is a very laid-back person- she was amazing about this, laughing with me--) I was itching to pull out a good lamp but I didn’t, so I’d give this a true test.<br />(Or because I wanted to test my patience. Two birds one stone)<br /><br />Now—here is the saving grace—<br /><br />the top coat is wonderful.<br /><br />It works like some of my best top coats- it leaves that perfect glassy look and it applies like a dream.<br /><br />Later I used the same top coat on my nails- and it worked just as well without the weird base coat and the horrible lamp and a totally different brand of nail polish.<br /><br />THIS WHOLE KIT AND THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE GOING FOR IT IS THE TOP COAT!<br />Now I get why this has good reviews—it’s the gel top coat.<br /><br />No wonder it lasts- I can only guess Red Carpet knows their top coat is fantastic, so they threw a bunch of bad apples in here –aware beginners won’t know any better.<br /><br />Please. You can buy wonderful topcoats for 10-20 bucks NOT 50 OF YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS- This is such a sad waste- and they don’t even throw in a file, or a plug in or red polish?<br /><br />I have more stuff coming from this brand—things I got before I tried this-- that I’m going to be trying-<br />I really hope this is their only issue... we shall see. <br /><br />I hope this review was helpful because I don’t want your money wasted. :(",0

I was interested in these because they don't just have the dotting stylus on both ends like my other set.  I liked the idea of the fine lines I could paint with the brush end.  They are also cute and sparkly so that is a bonus.  You don't get any instructions but there is always the internet.  I found the brush bristles to be a little longer than a normal paint brush length so they were harder to use until I got used to them.  I bet that length is handier for nails.  I like these overall.

Using the mask twice, I am really impressed by the effectiveness of this mask in terms of the smile lines and under-eye concentration masks. I genuinely can see a difference in my under eyes and the tightness of my face when I use this mask. Having tried another one of the 2-step masks, I do prefer the other mask set with the AHA acid peel for my younger skin. This mask, I think, would be a good option for those who have more mature skin, or who naturally have darker undereye areas. I found it really did brighten my under eyes. I would definitely give this mask a try if you want to focus on your undereye areas or want a boost of hydration in general.",1

My prior set of nail art tools had brushes as well, but the tips were definitely NOT as precise as these. The quality of these brushes is definitely comparable to some of my more expensive art brushes I use for minuscule detail work. Even after cleaning, the bristles haven't frayed or bent and the points are still precise. I paint ceramic houses and people each year for my mom to add to the Christmas village I started for her some 30 years ago, and I plan to buy another set or two of these nail art brushes to use instead of my regular paint brushes because these work so much better. They are also a fraction of the cost for art brushes with such tiny tips. The only fault I have with these tools is that the brush end is not glued on. If you pull on the metal portion, it comes right off. They aren't so loose that they fall off on their own, but I did glue them on to keep the brushes securely in place. The ends with the little ball tips don't have this problem and are securely attached to the plastic shaft. I highly recommend these brushes not only for nail art, but for any art or painted craft projects you may have planned. Even with the loose brush caps, I have to give these five stars.",1

One side is rounded dimples, the other side is raised brush-type projections.  Bought it for my husband’s shower because it looked fairly indestructible and he seems to be able to destroy pretty much any type of back scrubber.  This thing is thick, has some heft to it, and has sturdy grips at either end.  My husband was definitely more impressed with this one than some of the others I’ve handed to him for use in the shower.<br /><br />So, after his first shower with it I asked him how it went.  He looks at me and says “I’m not sure I’m using it the right way, but it works pretty good.”  And that was his idea of providing feedback on how it worked.  Of course, that’s not enough….especially when it starts with I’m not sure if I’m using it right.  Turns out (after tons of questioning, Good Lord it’s like bath scrubbers had suddenly become highly confidential state secrets) that it didn’t work all that well as a back scrubber for him.  He didn’t like that you have to lather up your back with a loofah or washcloth first and then use the back scrubber.  He tried to put soap on the scrubber and use it to wash his back but the soap just ran down between the scrubbers and he couldn’t build a lather up.  So he tossed it on the shower floor and was going to tell me that it didn’t work.  But then he decided to see if it would work to remove the callused skin on his feet.  Apparently it did.  He started by just leaving it on the floor of the shower and rubbing his feet back and forth on it, and that worked well.  But then he grabbed the handles and put some tension on it with his foot and moved it by using the handles.  Apparently this worked VERY well.  So well that he had brought up the brush he usually uses in the shower for his feet and threw it in the garbage.  (He said it needed replacing anyway.)  He wants to keep this one in the shower to keep using it on his feet & is completely excited that he doesn’t have to bend over and contort himself while scrubbing his feet anymore.  He still needs me to find a back scrubber though…….",1
AGADKXWLAJJ4FGWIDIWAPJL5A6HA,B08BY9P4HR,4,2020-08-11 13:52:04.310,Decent Brush For Thin Short Hair,"As most of us are in quarantine and not currently getting regular hair maintenance, having weird hair right now is just normal. I am growing out a pixie cut, not by choice, but by mandate of the State of Michigan. I have experienced a number of difficult hair transitions during this stay home, stay safe period, all of which I hope to never experience again. Currently, my hair is just too short to tuck behind my ear, so it is constantly falling in my face, but thankfully, I am past the super trendy mullet stage.<br /><br />When I had my pixie cut for seven years I washed my hair and dried it with a towel and went on with my life. No comb, no brush, no anything. It was really nice. Now that I actually have hair that tangles and needs attention I require tools. I have a brush with tight bristles that I like, but it pulls. I use leave in conditioner gel that seems to help, but I still pull a lot of hair. I have a very inexpensive comb that does absolutely nothing and I should probably just recycle it.<br /><br />This specific comb and brush set is definitely not the fanciest around. The comb has some heft to it and it does a good job getting my part straight. The brush is very stiff compared to my other brush, but it does not pull all my hair out when it hits a tangle. I also like that this brush doesn't mash my hair down. I have thinner hair and this brush doesn't make me look like I have thin hair.<br /><br />I don't use any styling products or tools, so I am not hard on my brush. I think this brush will hold up just fine in my hands, but I think if I person were using it with lots of accessories and products it might be a placeholder for a more expensive brush.",1

It has everything you need to get started, except for colors. Be sure to purchase a color or colors as well so you have everything you need. The lamp works great and all products arrived in mint condition and worked as described. Color usually stays on for 2 weeks, if you don't pick at your nails.<br /><br />I previously purchased a larger kit that I liked more than this kit (here): Red Carpet Manicure Pro 45 LED Gel Nail Polish Kit Soak Off Starter Package https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00662Z24A/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_MsVmFbXQFB0CA<br /><br />The reason I liked it more is because that kit came with more products and the lamp feels sturdier: 1 color, nail files and “erase” tube (what you use to remove the gel nail polish).<br /><br />However, if you’re on a budget - this kit is probably the way to go. AND you can pick which color or colors you’d like (separately).<br /><br />Even though at first glance this lamp seemed less nice, it works just as well.  My nails were fully cured within 45 seconds. After using it a few times and getting the hang of it, I’m usually able to do all my nails within 20-30 minutes. Easy to do while watching TV or listening to the radio. :)",1

Some kits try to force a look, but this one was open to play with. Maybe not the best idea for a beginner kit- but I enjoyed that.<br /><br />First the good:<br />I like this type of lamp when I'm doing gel- it's easy together both my hands in to hold the nail down when I first start, then I usually pick up the light and rotate it to get a full cure. Yes I have to restart the lamp a few times, but this isn't an expensive lamp so I don't mind.<br /><br />I liked the little box they came in- sure it's cheep, but it was a nice tough to have (almost) everything in once place.<br /><br />Then the annoying:<br /><br />There are a lot of odd little problems, like the Gel itself, two are jelly clear and one is opaque. Opaque gel takes a little longer to cure because the light works a bit harder to travel though the nail. It would have been helpful if they mentioned that, OR only gave you one type of gel-so it doesn't confuse you-- but they didn't.<br /><br />The nail forms were a bad fir for my hand. Thats just an unlucky break- all hands are diffrent- so im not including that in my rating, just something to mention in case they don't work for you too.<br /><br />The colors were a little annoying to use, no color indicator on the bottle. this is common with cheeper sets, but I thought I'd mention it anyway- It can make doing your nails just a little bothersome.<br /><br />The ugly-<br />they don't include slip solution-I ended up using my own from my nail kit, so I didn't have any problems, but that's a huge mistake on their part-- if you're just starting out you'll think gel nails are a sticky mess. Slip solution makes them manageable.<br /><br />Overall- I feel like there are better kits that will give you a cleaner start over this one--<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful!",0

Changer. I'm a busy mom and honestly, I just hate going to the nail salon, and who has time to wait for 300 hours (Ok, maybe not quite 300) for your regular nail polish to dry, only to smudge it or have it chip within 2 hours? I had pretty much given up on nail polish and just been resigned to the fact that I would have boring nails forever. This stuff is seriously incredible. You just paint it on, cure it, wipe the top with the cleanser to remove the tacky finish, and VOILA! Perfect nails! I did mine last week with this set and they still look AH-MAZING. When this set arrived, I was a bit bummed to find that there's no color included, just base and top coat. I live an hour from the nearest mall and so I couldn't just pop into the store and get a color, and yet I wanted to try it out... Like, right now. I did some reading and found that you can actually use regular nail polish to make a ""Gel-y"" sandwich. Once you have the base coat on, cure it, then paint your regular color over the top and wait the ""300 hours"" it takes to dry. Then paint the top coat over the regular color, cure, wipe with cleanser and enjoy your stunning, long lasting nails! The only thing I would change about this set is the light. I wound up buying a larger light because the one that comes with this set is quite small and I wanted to be able to fit all my fingers or all my toes in at once. This light is great for storing and being portable, but I personally wanted something bigger. Overall a fantastic set. I'm never going back to regular polish ever again!",1

I have to say I was very impressed with this bottle. Right off when I sprayed it, I noticed it came out different. It wasn't a spray, it was more of a mist spray so it sprayed more powerfully but evenly and wide. I used it right after I showered and towel dried my hair and then sprayed it and brushed.

I can usually find cleansers and moisturizers, but serums and eye creams are not so easy to track down. This travel set comes with a foaming cleanser, an eye cream, a serum, and a moisturizer as well as a beauty spritz. I wasn't sure what the spritz was for, so I sprayed it on my face after washing it, kind of like a toner, but later I discovered that it's more of a setting spray. The sizes are typical for travel. They're small and should last up to a week, I'm guessing. The individual products seem to be fine. I've used the foaming cleanser before, but the other items were all new to me. The scents were light and floral. None of the products were irritating. I have sensitive eyes and skin and nothing bothered them.

For $25.99 (at the time of writing this review), you get a lot of items!!<br /><br />I love that it comes in a cute little caboodle box! Everything fits in it great! So all of the stuff is together in one place and it’s small enough that it’s easy to store!<br /><br />The little pots of glitter cake together in a little zip lock bag, which I appreciated because some of the glitter had spilled out, so that kept it contained. It was only a few glitter particles, but I was still glad it was contained to the little bag! The poly gel tubes each come in their own little bags too, which I thought was nice. None of them leaked, but if they had it would have been very messy had they not been in a bag and still messy if they weren’t in separate bags. So, even though mine didn’t leak, I’m glad the company thought of the possibility and planned ahead just in case!<br /><br />The polishes all come in their own box. I wish they would have labeled the OUTSIDE of the boxes. The only thing on the boxes were “Nail Polish” on 2 of them and “Gel Nail Polish” on the rest. Since 2 were supposed to be the top and base coat and only 2 said “Nail Polish,” I figured those were the top and base coats. I was wrong. I’m not sure why 2 said “Nail Polish” and the others said “Gel Nail Polish,” especially since they’re all supposed to be Gel polishes 🤷‍♀️ So, I had to open each box and look at each nail polish bottle to see which ones were which. The base and top coats were labeled on the outside of the bottles. BUT, the colored polishes weren’t labeled in any way. So the only way to figure out which color was which was to open each one. A minor inconvenience, but annoying when they could have just labeled them with the colors! So, I ended up putting a dot of the polish on the top of each box so I’d know in the future. It would just be nice if in the future the company labels them better!<br /><br />The polish STINKS! It smells like burnt plastic 🤢 All Nail Polish stinks, but I’ve gotten used to the “regular” stink of nail polish. Smelling burned plastic while painting my nails is not something I’ve gotten used to! But, for the price of everything I got, it’s something I can deal with. But if smells bother you, this is not the kit for you!!!<br /><br />The UV lamp works okay. I took a few times of turning it on to get the nails to dry, but it’s small so I wasn’t expecting too much and they did and it was still faster than if I painted my nails with regular polish and waited for them to dry. So I’m happy!<br /><br />Overall, it’s a good little kit! I love that it comes all together in the cute little caboodle box. I love that you got an assortment of polish colors and an assortment of poly gel colors. I love that it came with the base and top coats. I love that it came with a UV lamp. I love it came with the tool needed for the poly gel nails. I love it came with glitter, foils, and strip tape to decorate the nails. I didn’t like that the polishes weren’t labeled better and I didn’t like the burnt plastic smell of the polish. But for everything I love and the affordable price for everything you get, I can get past those 2 things I didn’t like!!<br /><br />I’d say the only thing that would make me tell you to avoid getting this kit would be if you’re sensitive to strong smells because of the burnt plastic smell from the polish. Other than that, I’d recommend this kit!!",0
AGLIUT3VWAE7UEZHWVHNLDTBOAEQ,B08BZ1RHPS,3,2020-08-16 11:49:48.953,"Irritated, redness, inflamed","I gave this three stars a neutral rating rather than good or bad. Let me explain why. I was very interested in this product since I always use vitamin C in my regimen I'm always checking out different brands. Plus this one is also a revitalizing oil and I love products that brighten the skin. It's also a cruelty free product. It's a small bottle as you can see from my photo. Has a small dropper which is perfect since you only need a little bit. Now this product directs you to use this first after cleansing your skin before any other serums or creams. It directs 2-6 drops I recommend 2-3 or it'll be too oily. I still had a little trouble when applying my hyaluronic acid. (The drops are small). It has an awful smell that I can't place, but it's familiar from some other skincare products. This smell does go away thankfully. This product claims that your skin will feel light and refreshed. Mine didn't feel that. My skin felt nice to the touch but it felt very irritated and it was inflamed. It caused my skin to become very red (mean while I'm always trying to get rid of redness). I thought about cleaning my face off and starting over without this oil, but it was too late it was absorbed. My skin was left feeling very uncomfortable, irritated, and red. Fortunately I tried this on a day when I was just going to chill at home. I ended up applying a moisturizer that calms skin, reduces redness, and is great for sensitive skin. It helped very little with this particular issue but it usually does help. Please keep in mind that my skin is not really sensitive. Very few products have ever irritated it. I ended up very concerned about a breakout which I never get. This product is sadly not for me at all! So I gave this a neutral rating instead of a lower rating because it may work nicely for someone else. Thus far this has been my experience with this product. I really wanted to love it. Please take my entire review into account when deciding whether or not to purchase this. I personally cannot recommend this product. Especially to anyone with any skin sensitivity. I hope my review has been helpful.",0

This clay mask is fantastic. It comes in a squeeze tube which makes it easy to dispense how much of it you need. They tell you to apply it liberally to your clean skin. When you do that you will notice that fantastic fragrance this has which is great since you will have this on your face for 15 to 20 minutes or so.<br /><br />During that time it will dry out and harden. Once the time is up rinse it warm water. I prefer to do these masks before I go into the shower so I can just rinse them when I am in the shower, so much easier and less of a mess if you ask me.<br /><br />Once you are done you will notice that your skin eels actually nice and soft. A lot of these clay masks tend to dry up your skin but I was impressed that this one did not. It actually felt almost moisturized but I still followed it up with a nice moisturizer right after I was done like I always do.<br /><br />I have to say this clay mask is great. It smells fantastic, is nice and gentle and does not dry you out. There are not a lot of clay masks out there that I do like because most dry my skin out but this one is fantastic.",1

It comes in a dark glass bottle to protect the oil inside from light from degradation. The oil itself is applied using a dropper like most really. It is completely scentless which is disappointing but will work well for people sensitive to scents.<br /><br />They claim that it will not leave you with a greasy after feel, well I am not sure what they are talking about. It absorbs quickly but I definitely had a greasy residue on my skin and that stuck with me. I would recommend using this in the evenings only because of this. You wouldn't want to wear a face mask with this greasy feel on your face. You already sweat a lot in those masks and this would make you feel even worse in them. As an overnight moisturizing treatment this does work well though.<br /><br />But would I repurchase at this price? No way, there are other much nice products out there especially at that price.",0

Sticking a bath pillow to the wall only means that your vertical head has a bit of padding.  This bath pillow has changed that!  Because it's so long and softer than an inflatable pillow, it actually sort of creates that angle so my head does not have to vertical!

I love their scents and that they are based on grape ingredients. The set includes some of my favorites. One of them is the foaming cleanser that actually has lightweight and airy foam texture and Vinosource sorbet that has a great moisturizing effect on my skin and makes it look fresh. All of them have light scents that I like and and works gentle with my facial skin. This set is great if you would like to try a few things at once without spending extra money on the full bottles.

The eyeliner works great and the lashes adhere very well. The eyelashes themselves are beautiful and I love the lengths. The liner is easy to put on and so are the lashes. And, they stay on very well, with one exception.<br /><br />The eyelashes are too wide for my eyes, and I need to cut the last magnet off for them to fit properly. But, when I do that the outer end flips up and makes the lashes look terrible. If I don't cut them, they stick into the inner corner of my eyes, causing major irritation and immediately flip up, also making them look terrible. <br />I feel like they need one more magnet on the outer end, close to the last magnet. Because, most people need to trim any and all eyelashes, in order to make them fit their eyes better. In every video I've ever watched with glue on lashes, the person always has to trim the eyelashes just a little bit shorter in width. Why didn't the manufacturers of these eyelashes think that it would not be the same for these lashes?<br /><br />I love the concept, and really wish that these worked for me, because I have very dry eyes and cannot wear eye makeup and mascara.

AFQQQ5LGNSQUEBGDCYBAZZE5T3DA,B07DFNPVSF,5,2020-08-17 16:26:09.330,Youth Serum,"One of the reasons skin starts to wrinkle as we age is that we make less and less of the natural oil that keeps skin looking youthful. It's one of the reasons why people with oily skin seem to be ageless for so long. This serum is a good way to supplement what your skin lacks. The oils in this blend are all high quality. Some are slightly unexpected in a skincare product. The texture is lightweight and easily absorbed. It doesn't just sit on top of the skin. Your skin will feel softer immediately and you'll see more improvements over time. Dr. Denese is a trusted brand when it comes to care for aging skin. Whether you're trying to slow the clock or reverse it a little, this serum should be part of your daily skincare routine. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

It is best applied with your finger but will work with a brush as long as you wet it either with water or better with a setting spray to be honest. Make sure when you apply it that you put it in place where you want it. Going over it again tends to make a mess of it.<br /><br />The color is beautiful and I do really like that. It is very pigmented so that is good, just really load up and apply because if you go back and forth it just makes a mess and can flake off.",1

Well let me tell you it takes alot of practice and patience and knowing what your doing. Is it simple enough to understand, yes. However the sectioning hair, getting tangled, knotted or stuck was alot of the problems I ran into. If my husband had not been home I think I might have been in some real trouble. I'm not mild tempered and almost was pulling my hair out trying to get it unstuck at some points. I will say there were times when I got a rhythm going and I was getting my hair to go thru effortlessly but in the end once I was done I found pieces that weren't even in there and it was uncomfortable to wear unless maybe I was up doing stuff around the house. In the end I took it down and I'd had enough of the torture these provided. Overall would I suggest these yes to someone a little more familiar with there head and maybe to do in my daughter's hair but personally unless it's a day I'm bored and nothing else to do I may give it a go again. I will say my husband did see some curls in my hair when I ended up taking them out they didn't stay that way but he said he could see results and that was just in a matter of getting them all in. There may be potential there just not patience in my book.",0

Initially, I chose this particular set for the larger sized funnels that are also included, and the fact that it comes with (10) travel sized bottles.<br /><br />None of my bottles leak and they spray a fine, even mist without leaving droplets.  After seeing the spray function in action, I decided to use a couple of these for facial mists and essences. I don't know (yet) whether they'll spray every last drop, but the sprayer feed wraps all the way around the bottom of the bottle, which does look promising. 🤞 So far, every liquid I've put in them has been fine; the plastic didn't change and the sprays perform the same.<br /><br />Ultimately, I had to dock a star from my rating because the bottles came filthy inside, 😬 every one of them is heavily scratched up, and one of the bottles I received doesn't sit evenly. ➡️(see photos 3&4: defect (warped) bottle is on the right)⬅️<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Contains everything you need to package liquids immediately<br />+ Includes larger sized funnels = quick flow in filling<br />+ Spray nozzles produce fine, even mist without leaving droplets<br />+ Sprayer feed goes all the way around the bottom of the bottle<br />+ No leaking from the bottle necks or spray nozzles<br />+ Spray nozzles have not clogged<br />+ Caps fit tightly<br />+ No adverse reactions to the plastic (re: high alcohol content)<br />+ Airline approved carry-on size<br />+ Excellent price for ten bottles (and two funnels!)<br />+ Convenient PRIME shipping<br />+ Bonus sheet of labels (they're small, but they work)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Bottles came really scratched up and very dirty<br />- One of the ten bottles I received doesn't sit evenly<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Ultimately, I think there's some quality control issues that the manufacturer could improve upon. As long as you're not an Etsy seller, or someone that's gonna be gifting these, you may not mind the scratches or the possibility of uneven bottom(s).

You honestly do not even need a tutorial or instruction because of how simple it is to use. Simply plug in the lamp and it will automatically motion detect your hand and foot to trigger the lamp to dry. The default timer is set for 120 seconds but there are four other settings you can change to - 10s, 30s, 60s, 99s.

Also- I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My experience:<br />I'm not a makeup expert-- but when magnetic eyelashes first came out, I was a customer- so I’ve watched the market change over the years. At the time of this review you’ll finally find different styles of lashes, but all of them will be a bit stiff, and thick. Not many options for soft natural looking lashes in with magnetic application.<br /><br />The lashes styles:<br />These lashes have a decent range as magnetic lashes go with a few of the wispier, natural-ish options. So far though I haven’t seen any magnetic lashes on the market that look natural.<br /><br />Liner applicator:<br />This isn’t THE best liner applicator I’ve tried, but it is comparable to the best. In my experience the liner is the most important part of the lash set- not just because it’s the “glue” but it’s the item that makes the most difference on ease of application and finished look. Some liners are thick no matter what you do, this one allows a thinner line. (BUT magnetic lashes don’t do well with a pin line application, meaning you must add enough for the lash to grab on to) this made a thinner line work for me., (please note I have wrinkled and hooded eyelids, so everything I do is a little bumpy/ big)<br /><br />FIRST TIME USERS: these work best if you do ONE eye at a time. The lashes apply best when the liner is still a bit wet. NOT fully wet- but given a little time to START to dry. Think of the liner like glue- perfectly wet glue doesn’t hold paper together, and dry glue doesn’t stick.<br /><br />I recommend testing this liner on the back of your hand before your eyes, so you don’t end up looking like a panda as you practice—and the skin on your hand isn’t as sensitive as your eyelid. As you practice, remember that the lashes are reusable BUT can break easily --so practice with the set you like LEAST and be careful as you apply and remove.)<br /><br />Overall-<br />I recommend this set. There are MANY magnetic eylashe sets on the market, and this is one of the good ones.<br /><br />I’ll update this post with eye looks as I use each lash set and change my review if I see anything that should be mentioned.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!!",1

Also-I try to update my reviews, so they may change over time.<br /><br />My nail experience:<br />I am currently NOT a nail tech but I am practicing to become licensed. It’s something I enjoy—but is still a hobby.  I practice weekly, if not daily- on myself, hand mannequins, and other people. Sometimes I’m told to hurry up getting licensed- that I’m ""good enough""—but I’m in no hurry, busy trying out as many products as I can, watching nail content on YouTube and SkillShare.<br />SO--Though I am knowledgeable, I recommend you always trust licensed nail teaches over me.<br /><br />Art liner brushes-- overall look:<br />I'm a sucker for the embedded crystals look that these brushes have. Its a common look for nail brushes- this style is everywhere, but I always find it pretty. The crystals are loose, wiggling around in the open center- sometimes making a faint clicking noise. This style always looks bougie to me.<br /><br />The brush tips:<br />these preform fine- had a few brush hairs I had to get wet and smooth-- nothing bad. after a little forming they do what they are intended to do. If you're new to brushes like these, the long fine lines help create smoother thin lines and the stubby brushes are good for more precise detail.<br /><br />Cost:<br />At the time of this review these brushes cost 6.99. for five brushes that's roughly 1.25 for each brush. Not a bad cost. You can get better brushes- they'll have less imperfections and will cost more-- but these do fine.<br /><br />I see these brushes everywhere-- and the'll randomly pop up at different price points- sometimes even as a free bonus for a more expensive nail kit. So if you want to shop around you may be able to find them cheeper-- but I still think this is a good price.<br /><br />Overall:<br />They are what they say they are.  If you like the look on the page- I don't think they will disappoint.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful!",1

I follow the directions and apply a few drops on my freshly cleansed skin prior to any other products. It makes my skin feel amazingly soft. I have no trouble applying my other serums after this.

This brush feels strong where not too much pressure or weight is required to detangle. The bristles on this brush are round and feels so good against your head. I have thick hair so I need something to get through the hair jungle and this brush does the job.

It is single layered so you won't get too warm wearing it. The part that goes behind the back of your head is narrower than the part that goes above your forehead. I wished the forehead part was narrower. I found the button placement fine for my mask (but it would be easy to adjust to your liking with some basic sewing skills). I like that the headband is snug but not uncomfortable. It does slide up a little in the back after a while. Something anti slip on the back would be nice to help keep the headband in place. It may be too tight if you have a larger head. The only thing I don't really like is the large logo. If it couldn't be eliminated it should be smaller or the color of the font be darker so it's not as obvious. Personally, I like the black because it blends into my hair for an inconspicuous look.",1

Its very strong but not overpowering. Truly one of the best things I've smelt.<br /><br />APPLICATION: Goes on fairly oily and blends pretty well. Immediately brings color to my face, I have medium skin and it starts with an apricot redness but fades back to an awakened tone. I really enjoy that about this, I see others complain about this so maybe it's not best for fair skinned people?.<br /><br />Once dry, I am left with a matte sheen that is well hydrated.

It doesn't unscrew, that's not what I'm talking about. It's the spray head itself. I think if the bottle wasn't so heavy this wouldn't be an issue, but when spraying downward, the bottle will move due to the weight. If I hold the bottle with one hand, while spraying with the other, all is well.<br /><br />A possible solution to this might be to purchase these 16 oz amber glass bottles separately, then purchase a separate pack of very highly rated, top quality spray nozzles & a sheet of labels to see if that helps. Perhaps these sets are being sold with lower quality spray nozzles. I really cannot say.

Usually when my hands get bad (even just one hand) I have to apply a cortisone rub a few times a day over a few days to make the redness, flakiness, and itchiness subside.<br /><br />I was hesitant to get this because the ingredients seem pretty simple for something that is supposed to make a difference in psoriasis.  Well I am surprised at how effective this spray is.  Instead of touching the cortisone rub at all - I just sprayed this on the backs of my hands.  Granted I was working form home for the entire day - so I pretty much sprayed it a bunch of times over the course of the day.  The redness got MUCH better.  And the flakiness totally went away.  The only thing is my skin on the bad hand looked a bit dry - but I guess that is because this is a spray and not an emollient cream or anything.  To the touch, my hand felt pretty soft with only the slightest dry patches felt.  Anytime I can avoid cortisone (steroids) I consider a really good time.<br /><br />I am happy with this spray and have a feeling I will always have to keep some on hand going forward.  Some might think the price may be a bit much - but if it works...plus if you can avoid drugs - it is probably worth it.

I take a lot of medications that make my nails weak and brittle, and any surface that's too abrasive wreaks havoc on my fingertips. I can't carry a full size glass nail file with me everywhere, so I was on the hunt for a travel sized file that could fit in my pocket, wallet, or purse. When these came up, I thought I'd give them a shot. The pros are the files are a great size, they're packaged well, and I see them lasting for awhile. The case they come in is a nice touch, and I enjoyed the fact there were two so I could have a spare. They're pretty to look at, if that matters to you. They'd make great little stocking stuffers or gifts. There were a few con's to the files, but nothing too major. The abrasive side is only on one side of the file. I prefer to have options on the level of abrasiveness, so this was a little disappointing. In addition, the abrasive side didn't do all that great a job filing down my nails. It will do in a pinch, and it's not my favorite file, but for emergency use, it will do. If you need a glass file for travel purposes, this is the best option I have found so far, despite the minor drawbacks.",1

These are about the perfect size for our kids as they don't fill up the bath tub. They don't take much time to dissolve in warm bath water. This was a package of 18 round bath bombs. A couple of them were broken, maybe during shipping or just not enough ingredients but the kids didn't mind at all. They are all individually wrapped in paper so they didn't make a mess in the box. They are scented with some kind of a flower scent which is good and not as overpowering. There is around 8 different colors that does color the bath water. I haven't notice any staining or rings in the tub from using just these bombs.",1

The biggest issue I have is them pinching my eye when I’m clamping down to curl them. I always have to lightly clamp down to see if I’ll pinch myself and, if I will, then adjust. Then, I end up having some parts not curled. I’d been looking for a new curler for a while, when I saw this I figured it was worth a try since I also got mascara.<br /><br />Someone in the reviews had said the package came damaged. Mine also did. It wasn’t too bad, just seemed a little beat up. But, the products inside were completely fine and didn’t seem damaged at all, so I was okay with that.<br /><br />I am very picky about my mascara. Well, not so much the mascara as I am the mascara wand. With my small, hooded eyes, it makes it so I end up with a lot of mistakes of the wand hitting below my lower lash line or onto my hood. So, I prefer thinner wands. I wasn’t sure what to expect with this mascara, but I was also getting a lash curler so I figured I’d hopefully like at least 1 of them. I’m happy to say that the mascara wand isn’t too thick. It’s not extremely thin, but still thin enough so it works for me. It also has a little bend to it, which helps with application. The mascara goes on very easily and doesn’t clump up after a few coats, which is great! It stays on all day without smearing. But, it also washes off easily at the end of the day, which I always love. It’s hard to find a mascara that stays all day without smearing or smudging, but is easy to wash off. So, it’s nice this does both!<br /><br />The lash curler is amazing! It’s lightweight. It feels so nice. I love the red, black, and gold. It looks so fancy! It fits my eyes really well and curls my lashes AMAZINGLY without pinching my eyes at all! I’m really happy with it! It also comes with replacements for the rubber part on the curler, so that was great!<br /><br />For $11.99 (at the time of writing this), it’s an amazing deal! You’re getting an amazing lash curler and an amazing mascara. You can’t beat that! If you’re looking for a great mascara, a great lash curler, or both, you should definitely give this a try!",1

The internal spray tubes are plenty long enough to reach every bit of liquid in the bottle and wide enough to pull up good amounts of fluid. There's no excessive spraying because the amount discharged is so little.

Obviously this isn't a big deal, most of us already own a file and if you don't, you can pick on up almost anywhere for $1 or so, but it's the principal for me. LOL. I mean, even the cheapest pack of press-on nails usually includes a tiny emery board file.<br /><br />That's such a minor complaint though.<br /><br />Besides that, I wish the lamp were a bit bigger. I'm not very graceful and tend to bump the side of smaller lamps with my wet nails as I put my hand under the lamp. At the same time, I appreciate the compactness of this whole kit... I'm actually keeping it in my desk at work for emergency touch ups so I'm not complaining about the size, just an observation... it's a matter of preference and need.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this kit for a professional/experienced person, but I DO recommend it for a beginner or as I use it - a compact, portable solution for chipped nails on the go (traveling or at the office).",1

I have long thick coarse curly hair that fizzes very easily and immediately after every shower if I dont use a product in it. I used this before I used any other products but it did not detangle my hair very much compared to how it normally is. I still had to pull through quite a few knots but it didnt seem to take as many pulls to get through them as it normslly does. So I guess that would be considered an improvement. I feel like my hair is volumized and softer with about 5-7 sprays throughout my entire head of hair. This is a thin spray so it is very lightweight and has the consistency similar to water so I dont feel like my hair is at all greasy from this. I used a curl definer like I always do after showers that helps deter the frizz and keep my curls bouncy and it worked well with it. I dont think this product is worth the money for what little it does do. I wouldnt repurchase.,0

You get 4 glitter polishes and one standard black polish with this set.  It does NOT include a base/top coat.<br /><br />You can use just as it is. The glitter does really pop when applied over the black or just as a glitter polish.  This brand offers some excellent coloring.  Often glitter polish has a full look, this is rather vibrant.  I did also apply the glitter polish over other brands of gel and had no issues.  You need a base coat if you are applying the black (or other color) gel polish on your natural nails, but if you are applying the gel polish on your acrylic or polygel nails you can skip the base coat.<br /><br />Overall this applies very easily, has standard set times using a UV/LED Light.  I got a little over 2 weeks right at 3 weeks before I had any chips or other issues.  For MY nails and daily activities that is a very long lasting gel.

There’s a huge misconception that when a product is super soapy and there’s a lot of bubbles, it’s cleaning. That’s simply not true. You have to read the ingredients to see if those ingredients clean-which this shampoo does.<br /><br />Personally, this shampoo did a great job at cleaning my hair. It took 2 pumps for my hair that’s medium length. It’s a huge bottle that comes with a lot of product. The shampoo itself is thick and clear (no color added). I let my hair air dry and there’s was dramatically less frizz.<br /><br />I was shocked at the results. My hair is soft and shiny after three uses and I love how my hair looks and feels.

The brush is a little curve so it can help with the application.<br /><br />My first impression wasn't that good, since the mascara felt so thin that looks like I wasn't really wearing almost anything. It dried so fast that when I tried to apply the second layer, it wouldn't let me because it was already dry and the brush wouldn't run nice and soft through my lashes. However, I added 2-3 drops of castor oil (you can also use almond oil or any other natural oil that you like) and it was a game changer. I instantly felt the brush was running smoothly on my lashes, and was able to apply a second and even third layer with no problem. Lashes looked way better (not to mention they were also being lubricated with the added oil).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Does not smudge<br />- Easy to remove with makeup remover or even in the shower<br />- When removed, it comes out in small flakes which is great because it does not leave you with raccoon eyes<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very thin mascara (although this might be a pro for some people)<br />- Felt a little dry at the beginning but manage to ""enhance"" it with castor oil (as mentioned above)",1

The box itself was nicely packaged. For reference, I used the thinnest/most natural pair at the top for my review.<br /><br />Cons: the tube of eyeliner was either sitting so long it completely dried up, or the glue caused the eyeliner to adhere to the inside of the tube, but it was almost impossible to get ANY of the liner on my lid.<br /><br />When I finally got a line to go on, it was akin to what attempting to using a dried up Expo on whiteboard looks like- I had to scrub the pen on my eyelid in an attempt to lay down any product at all, resulting in a very pitiful looking eyeliner application.<br /><br /> I fixed the lashes to the appropriate area, and within 5 minutes they were coming off at the corners. I tried to remedy the overall result somewhat by adding my own liner, and that example is on the second photo, bottom right corner (photo with eyeshadow applied).<br /><br />The lashes themselves were the quality you’d expect from a multi pack at this price. Some of the individual lashes had fallen out as I opened the package as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts: just use eyelash glue and get quality lashes. It doesn’t take any more time to apply and at least you can apply eyeliner to suit your taste.",0

AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,B08B5FJMHM,5,2020-08-27 21:36:22.499,"So Far, So Good","These have been working well so far. I mainly ordered them to scrub my face so my tinted moisturizer goes on more smoothly. I have combination skin that has both black & white heads plus dry skin. When I ordered these, I expected them to be half the size. So for my intended purpose, they are a bit of overkill. Once they are fully wet, they get a lot thicker & fluffier. In order to get my nose properly scrubbed, I bend the loofah & use the bent edge. It works.<br /><br />I hang these to dry on a copper rod that is just small enough to accommodate the little hanging loop that these have on them. This then hangs in front of a window which gets a lot of sun. It's a great way to get them to dry & to help fight bacteria.<br /><br />I hope they are 100% natural. I read in one of the questions that it has a foam core. I'm not too sure what to think of that. Really, with all the Chinglish & poor spelling, what should one think aside from, ""Oh, it's yet another made in China item being sold on amazon."" For the record, these loofah's will not ""remove horniness"" OMG, they really need to get someone to clean up their listings LOL!<br /><br />Overall, I'm really surprised by the quality & the size of these esp. after the lack of quality control in the listing. When you order stuff online, you never know what you're going to get. Time will tell how long they hold up for. I expect/hope they last a long time.",1
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,B08FD2KP9R,3,2020-08-27 21:38:17.736,"Nice, silicone back 'brush' bit too soft. Good handles.","We gave this 3 test uses for an initial assessment of this back scrubber/brush. It is designed nicely, with handles that make usage very user friendly. If they made this out of elastic, you could shower and do resistance band exercises. hehe. Seriously, the handles work well, and act as convenient loops to hang the device to dry out in the shower.<br />There is an issue with using silicone brush heads, they tend to be soft/flexible. So, if you use this brush, do not expect the same experience as a loofah or bristle brush. And, you have to really work up a lather in your hands and then transfer it to the silicone brush head. Attempts to create foam/lather by rubbing body wash or soap on the silicone just wasn't satisfactory.<br />As mentioned, the brush surface tends to be soft/gentle. The 'scrubbing' side does rub, but nowhere near deep cleaning or exfoliating level. The bumpy side, for massage, does provide a textured rub, but is even less effective for soaping and cleaning your back.<br />Maybe I'm too old school, liking my cleaning brush to be able to really scrub.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with a ruler for size reference.<br />Did not use the included hooks, because we used the shower caddy that already had hooks for shower accessories. The bonus bath sponge looks fine, but did not use that yet. Again, maybe I don't pamper myself enough while showering. haha. If the significant other uses it, any pertinent information will be added to this review. However, I think the majority of people will be concerned about the effectiveness and quality of the back scrubber.<br />So, the product does match the description and depiction in the product details. However, my opinion is the softness of the brush hinders the effectiveness as a shower back scrubbing device. I do like that it is very resistant to mold and is extremely easy to clean and maintain. Maybe I have to learn to adapt to the softer texture of this type of brush. Based on our experience, this silicone brush garners a 3.5 rating. If you already use and like silicone back scrubbers, this is a quality product worth considering. If you are old school, this might disappoint expectations.",0

I wanted glass, rather than plastic, for these purposes.  The bottles themselves are top notch - heavy duty glass, nice size that is easy to hold yet doesn’t require constant refilling.  There are two included cap tops which are also nice - leak-proof if you want to store something in them that you either don’t need the sprayer for, OR, are transporting them somewhere and want to make sure no spillage.  The sprayer on the other hand, is not so great.  I do like that the sprayer tube is extra long... meaning you can get down to the last few drops.  But it feels cheap overall.  Other problems with the sprayer:  the screw on top fits pretty firmly, but the nozzle does not stay in place - it sort of swivels around.  This gets to be annoying if you are squirting multiple squirts because the nozzle keeps shifting.  The other thing that might be an issue for some is that there are only two settings and they are BOTH mist settings.  It appears that one is a slightly finer mist than the other (barely) but I am not 100% sure that is even the case.  This is not a problem for me because of the purpose I am using them... but wanted to point this out in case it might be a problem for others.  Overall the glass bottles are great but the nozzles need some work.  It also comes with 4 black labels - the labels actually are sort of a thin rubbery material and seem really nice... but what the heck am I going to use to write on BLACK labels?",0

I did do some research and watched several videos to learn the process before even venturing into trying my own. Boy, I had NO idea what I had gotten myself into... This is nothing like my beloved Acrylics! But, for a little laugh, and a few Pro ""lift proof"" tips along the way, I've added a video at the top to show my adventure.<br /><br />First, none of the nail forms seem to come close to fitting any of my nails properly, and my mind could not even grasp this whole strange concept not one bit. So, I just added a tip and began to apply the gel as I would acrylic. The gel is extremely thick and sticky and very hard to work with, unlike the gel from the past. The kit did not include a slip solution, which would be hard for those just starting out and may not have 70% alcohol at home. I did have some, but it really didn't help, aside from keeping the brush clean, as the gel was so thick and almost unworkable. It took me about 20 minutes to complete one nail from start to finish, including polish. <br /><br />It was quite frustrating that none of the boxes for the Polish were marked, neither did they have curing times noted. The instructions also did not include this information for the polishes. But, in the end, I had a pretty nice looking poly gel nail for the first time ever.<br /><br />I appreciate that the kit comes with all the necessities, aside from the slip solution. It also contains quite a few glitters and tapes to get creative. The light is very small, but it gets the job done, even if it takes a few extra seconds. Once the nail is cured, you get a very hard and shiny finish. The polishes are very nice, although I don't care for a few of the colors myself, the topcoat is very thick.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice kit. I enjoyed the learning experience and will likely play around with it again. And, I may try those strange nail form attachment things. Although I could have done over half a set of nails in acrylic in the time it took to do my one nail in polygel~~ everyone has to start somewhere, it's always fun to learn something new and the first time usually takes the longest.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit for those starting out new and fresh, or those who are seasoned a bit doing poly gel. You definitely get a lot for your money, and you will get a nice strong nail from this kit. I'm giving 4 stars ✨ for the lack of information on the packaging and instructions on colors and curing times. But, I really do think I will like it much better once I get the hang of it.",1

This is true, but I personally don’t think that’s a reason not to get this set. I do think it’s worth noting that you’re getting a REALLY nice quality glass bottle in a 2-pack for under $15. Personally, the nozzle moving didn’t bother me at all and I am really pleased with the quality. Love the amber glass, because as the description mentions - this makes it safe to mix up your own concoctions with essential oils and it doesn’t ruin the oils.

The deodorant on the PF brand slides on thicker and isn't as hard as the Native deodorant so it would be easier to apply too much with the PF than with Native. Not huge but something to consider.<br /><br />They both seem to do an equally good job at keeping odor away and I noticed no increase in odor while wearing the PF vs. the Native.<br /><br />Price-wise they are about the same so you really don't save money either way.<br /><br />Fragrance-wise I didn't really have a preference for one brand vs. the other, they both have a nice range of fragrance and there is enough variety to appeal to most people.<br /><br />Because of application, I will be sticking with Native, but if you are looking for something that glides on a bit thicker than this would be the best choice.",1

I am not ever going to spend $300 - $400 on a hair dryer.  No way!  This one looks a lot like a Dyson.  I can't imagine how a Dyson would be better than this one.  This one is great!  I LOVE it.  I have curly hair and it works wonderful for me.  I dry my hair upside down with the diffuser on cool.  That really helps to cut down on the frizz.  It takes awhile but it's worth it.  I change out the nozzle and use one of the other tools to dry and lift at my scalp.  It gives me a lot more volume.  The dryer is a little heavier than some of my other dryers.  Yes, I have several.  I also like that you don't get all hot and sweaty when drying your hair.  My husband loves that I don't heat up the bathroom!  I really can't say enough good about this dryer.  It is well worth the price.  If you want hot air, this probably isn't the best dryer for that.  It doesn't get really hot.  The cord is long.

If I was just rating the bottle and accessory label I would give this 5 Stars.<br /><br />However, the Spay nozzle is trash.  It's decent plastic but to large for the bottle, the connector point between the sprayer and the bottle doesn't close properly so it leaks if this bottle is tilted and DO NOT turn the bottle over if spaying your hair upside down.  Then the nozzle turns , like rotates 360.  I don't know if it was designed to do that and if it was then okay, but it's still horrible.  One of my spray nozzles broke after 1 use, the pin on the inside of the handle must have let go because if you squeeze the trigger nothing happens it just pushes up and stays in place.<br /><br />Overall, I just couldn't give it more then 3 stars because of the issues.

I myself have used several different kits, and this one ranks in my top 5. The results were pretty good and there was noticeable lifting of my lashes. I estimate I will be able to get roughly 3 perms out of this kit in total which is pretty good, especially considering the price.

Baking soda, coconut oil, shea butter, and vitamin E are included along with some natural essential oils that add a pleasant aroma. This company offers different scent options - this one is rather flowery, with scents like ylang ylang and gardenia. This is certainly somewhat expensive for a deodorant but it is worth paying extra to get something natural with organic ingredients that won't irritate your skin or harm your health. Unlike some products that just spray on scents this item uses baking soda to help absorb odors too.

He has told me that he really likes the way this shampoo cleans his beard and the fact that it lathers well without having to apply much product which for me is a win cuz that means less money spent in the long run. Overall he has def enjoyed using this product and we're still gauging if this is something we would repurchase but if we did it would def be because it's long lasting.,1

I'm on a forever quest for my perfect red - my number one favorite so far is cruella by nars. This is a tight second! It's a much different shade then cruella, so it brings a totally different vibe. It's a beautiful true red falling slightly warmer than cool toned. The formula is amazing. I like that it has a matte finish but it's not a matte that sucks the life and moisture out of your lips. It feels very comfortable, not like a heavy lipstick. You can easily get an undone faded look, like you're not trying too hard(compared to going all out with lip liner etc). I love the way it wears too, it doesn't just disappear in certain spots. Great staying power overall. I'd rank this with more expensive beauty brands, it's an amazing formula.

The packaging is absolutely beautiful and I like that the ingredients are on the more natural side. I will say that it's amazing at removing makeup; it's effective and non-greasy. You can see on the dirty cotton ball that it took off every bit of my mascara and eye shadow. Unfortunately, it stung my eyes a little, like a mild soap would, and that's pretty much a deal breaker for me with eye makeup remover. As for use on the rest of my face, again it was quite effective. Just out of curiosity, after cleansing with the C'est Moi, I did a second once over with a cotton ball soaked in Micellar Water - my face was already completely clean; no makeup had been left on my face at all, but I did feel that there was a slight residue sitting on my skin. I didn't feel squeaky clean like I prefer, which lead me to believe I would be better off rinsing, but that kind of defeats the purpose of a cleansing water, in my opinion. So while I really liked the idea of this product, and it worked, I would not purchase it again.",0

It is thick and basically feels like wet pottery in your hands (hence the clay), smells nice (somewhat perfume-y) and most importantly, feels like something I’d get at a spa. When I first put it on, I was surprised by the warming sensation, since I didn’t realize it had that effect. I liked it! I’ve had masks like that before and they just add another dimension to the experience. I left it on for 10 minutes and washed it right off.

Not the easiest thing to sleep with, clearly, but curls come out bouncy and look great with all day wear.

However, I can well imagine mileage may vary with individual body chemistry, so it may be worth a try if you're feeling like a gamble.<br />The deodorant is comfortable, non itchy, and doesn't leave a lot of residue.

It works for me, even if loofa does take a while to break in. However, it also absorbs quite a bit of soap. I like this one much better.<br /><br />I was a little hesitant to order it. How would silicone feel against my back? It turns out that it feels fine and works well. I like that it needs much less soap since it doesn't absorb it. Instead of spreading it all over the thing - I like the side with little bristles like a brush - all you need is to put some in the center. Moving the brush over your back spreads the soap out nicely and does the job without a lot of waste. It squeaks a bit on un-soaped skin, but that's pretty easy to get over and doesn't last long. It was just a surprise, initially. It feels like a gentle scrub, and that's the important part. It also rinses off easily and dries quickly, an important point here in our humid climate. The interior relative humidity in our house hovers around 55% in the summer, so things can get moldy fast. That's what usually happens if a loofa or any other kind of absorbent surface isn't dried properly. I just hang this up on the thoughtfully provided suction hooks and forget about it. It's great, and I'm really glad I gave this a try!",1

There is no way to make them spiral at all.  More like standard old school curls.<br /><br />I found them a bit hard to use as well - as I found it a big pain to get the stick through the curler.  I ended up squashing like four of five on the stick at a time (since that was the truly painful part) and then using it on my hair one after the other.  Plus even though I cut my hair to like shoulder length - these are actually pretty short - just for the ends of your hair really.<br /><br />With that being said - I tried these one night after a shower - letting my hair dry by at least half.  I put the curlers in while watching TV.  Left them in for like an hour, ran my hairdryer over them until my hair felt dry and took them out.  My hair definitely had some bounce and was sort of curly.  So if you are looking for body - these might definitely work.  If you are looking for tight curls (especially spirals) - probably look elsewhere.  On the plus side - for work the next day - my hair still had some body and felt thicker when I put it up.  So again - they did definitely add body to my hair.<br /><br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : )",0

The flaw is the spinning sprayer that allowed my expensive orange cleaner to pour out of the top all around the nozzle.  cheaply made  but all in all a good glass bottle with a terrible srayer . If you just need a bottle with a screw top your good. If you have a different sprayer you can take off a plastic bottle great. Thats what I did.

The magnetic eyeliner makes it harder to apply and keep these on. Also, if you get the eyeliner in your eye, you better have an eyewash station nearby. These are almost like toy false lashes for kids to play dress up with if the eyeliner wasn’t so toxic. The lashes (3 sets) come stacked in a compact that just feels breakable and not well made. The lashes themselves are very synthetic, and not natural looking at all. I like that the kit includes an eyelash tweezer applicator, but honestly that will be the only thing getting use from this kit. It’s a great concept, just poorly executed. The liner goes on and you have to quickly get the lashes placed, or you’ll lose adhesiveness by the second. Even when done in a timely manner, the magnetic components in the eyeliner don’t work well with the magnetic strip on the lashes, so they won’t stay on long. They are large and clunky and just look very unnatural, even when trimmed. The lashes themselves have a wire look and consistency to them, and look very similar to the lashes on a toy doll, only thicker and heavier looking. Would not recommend these, even for the low price.",0

This for me it's a good thing because I know it's really sanitizing my hands. It also has a nice subtle scent. This doesn't leave my hands greasy at all, which was a concern of mine. It moisturizes my hands. It does not leave any kind of film on my skin (don't use too much) which ends up picking up dirt and kinds of yucky things. (Example: after applying a greasy lotion on your hands it causes your hands to be quite dirty) My hands feel soft, not greasy, and sanitized.

Overwhelming. It was an 80's nightmare, actually. To top it off, the curlers didn't hold up well, either, and most of them had holes and tore after one use.

It is poorly designed and doesn’t quite cover the entire area where hair would fall on your neck. The combs are OK and so are the clips. The case can be used to keep everything together as long as the zipper works.<br /><br />Overall: not something I can recommend",0

It’s in a box, and everything is in it nicely.<br /><br />I’ve been doing my own nails, and wanted a drill to make it easier. I was a little scared since I’d never used one on myself before. This one was so easy! It comes with instructions. It’s so easy to work! It is easy to hold and maneuver, it isn’t too big or heavy. It doesn’t get too hot. I love that all the controls for the drill are on the power cord, so I don’t accidentally hit anything and end up hurting myself while I’m using the drill! I love how it comes with so many attachments! It even comes with a little brush so you can dust off any dust. The one thing I wish is that it had a standard plug, rather than a USB. It seems so many things are USB plugs now though, so it is what it is. But, if it had the standard plug, it would have been perfect! Other than that, I have no complaints!<br /><br />The ease of use and compact size make this perfect for a beginner like me!<br /><br />EDIT: There’s no switch or anything to remove the different heads. You just need to pull it out. They push in easy enough, but my goodness are they hard to pull out! It makes sense since you’d been using it and it was rotating.

It’s a light powder that comes out of the container through little holes so I have control over how much powder I want in the top of the container where I pick up the powder with my makeup brush. The design is wonderful. It’s sheer & applies nicely with my discretion. It’s the last product I put on my face in the morning. I don’t wear foundation or any of that. After cleansing I use toner (not everyday) then my moisturizer with sunscreen & primer. Finally I’m complete this great face setting powder. I’ve never found anything that keeps my face in place before I found this. Hours later no oil can be seen on my face~and my skin is oily! Late afternoon I may use the face blotting tissues to set my face more, depending on where/what I’m doing. Even then little oil shows through. In the past I’ve used a matte powder which worked but not as good as this. My skin color would be considered beige in the matte powder so I was hesitant on this “Translucent” color but it blends in wonderfully. I don’t look too pale or too dark. I love it!

You will need a base gel and top coat, but if you have used gels before then those are things you should already have in your polish collection,  if not I recommend purchasing a base/top coat before purchasing these.

That is precisely what I had in mind when I ordered Follain Mattifying Moisturizer.  I have dry, sensitive skin but its not oily. My husband has oily skin. I have fine lines and wrinkles on my face. My husband does not.  Because Follain moisturizer promises to combat oily skin, as well as fine lines and wrinkles and is a clean, vegan product, I ordered it to find out if it could help the both of us with our skin issues.  I'm happy to tell you that it has helped the both of us.  The moisturizer is a bit thinner than I'm used to. I don't say that in a bad way because its not at all bad.  One pump of the canister delivers enough moisturizer to cover my facial skin. Its very lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a look or feel of oily/greasy skin. It provides immediate hydration and does a nice job of softening my skin. I am VERY happy to say I absolutely have a noticeable reduction in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face. They don't go away entirely, but there is a definite reduction in size and appearance. ( I can't tell you how much I needed to experience this right now as my 49th bday is this week...that means 5-0 isn't far behind and I'm kind of starting to freak about it! )  My husband also tried this for his oily skin with impressive results.  Follain controls his oily skin and prevents the shiny, damp look that comes with oily skin thanks to the mattifying benefit of this moisturizer.  We both use it as needed and not even on a daily basis.  Follain works and it works well. We're both very pleased and grateful for the results!",1

I can combat that with lotion and loofahs, but it's hard to loofah the center part of your back, you know?<br /><br />The other side of this scrubber is for a massage type feel, but I wasn't digging that as much as the other side. I did wish that there was some way to make more suds on both sides, like a loofah does, but it works.

It has gotten coarser, dryer, and duller as I've gotten older so what I need from a conditioner may be different than someone with a different type of hair. I found that this conditioner took about three days of use before it actually made my hair start to feel soft, but even after some time, it wasn't as soft as some other conditioners can make it. On the bright side, comb out was easier with this than some other conditioners. It also didn't weigh my hair down or flatten out the natural waves. It left my hair bouncy and full of body. However, it also didn't do much for shine enhancement or split ends/repair as far as I could tell.<br /><br />The scent on this conditioner is very herb-like (as you'd expect) and not especially strong which I prefer in a conditioner as I don't like the scent lingering in my hair. It is fairly thick and a smaller amount goes a long way.

My face looked bright and clear. It was very hydrating and felt cool and relaxing. Definitely great for pampering oneself. The mask is thin and biodegradable. It's filled with serum. It actually drips off the chin area. I just use that for my neck. The serum doesn't leave a film on my skin like many do.

This conditioner helps to balance your hair's pH level in addition to repairing damage. It's also very hydrating. It has just the right amount of oil to tame curly hair. The scent is fresh and lightly herbaceous. The texture is on the thicker side but not like a deep conditioner. It's a good overall product for all hair types.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

I have to file off the layers of top coat, which can take a while if I don’t have a good file. I prefer a glass file for actually shaping my nails, but they’re not good for removing layers of polish.<br /><br />Using one of these files, I had the top coat filed off all my nails in less than ten minutes. The 100 grit side is perfect. I actually asked a nail tech friend what I should use, and she told me 100 grit.<br /><br />The files come in a zipper seal plastic bag that can be used to store them.<br /><br />The edges of the files aren’t sharp. I’m talking about the edges that touch your skin; sometimes these can be sharp, especially on pro files, and need to be seasoned to prevent cuts. No problems with that here.",1

The mask was super saturated out of the package, so I had to scrape some of the serum off to keep it from dripping.  I also had to fold the large mask over in a few spots where it covered my hairline on all 3 sides.  On my face the mask was cool and refreshing.  Conveniently, it didn’t slip at all, even while sitting up and looking at my cell phone.  I could smell the green tea, but it wasn’t overwhelming.  TIP:  I’ve learned that Karuna masks leave A LOT of serum on the face that doesn’t easily absorb into the skin once the mask is removed.  I left the mask on for 30 minutes, increasing absorption and letting it dry out a bit...I highly recommend this, followed by splashing cool water on your face to gently remove any excess serum.  This prevents sticky skin and left my face feeling smooth and soft almost immediately.  Within 2 hours my skin felt hydrated and looked brighter and super clean.  Very happy with this mask!",1

I tried the videos, and the hacks that say cut them ...I tried applying with special lash tweezers... Nothing works to get them close to the lash lid. The magnetic is strong so I'm sure it won't fall off, but it's so strong that when you start to move the under lash toward your eye with the upper lash laying on top of your lashes, the magnetic pulls and moves is soil quickly that it always ends up locked half way through your natural lashes.

I made a wig out of the bundles and closure but after two weeks I ended up discarding the hair all together.<br /><br />Pros: the hair was true to length and closure was full but not overly thick. The bundles can take color. ( only used a vegan, ammonia free semi-permanent dye in blue-black). The closure only shedded lightly.<br /><br />cons: The bundles shedded like crazy. The hair tangled very easily. I’m pretty experienced with curly hair and this was by far some of the worst hair I have every use. The description said deep wave but my hair was more on the curlier side.<br /><br />The biggest cons of all was the amount of white/gray hairs in the closure. They were very noticeable and would not take any color and we’re different lengths from the rest of the hair on the closure. I eventually ended up plucking most of the white hairs out because it just didn’t look good on me.<br /><br />I meant pictures and post this review over a month ago but did have a chance to.

AF4P6A3SEKS2HCISWAKFZVIFM7NQ,B086W18W1W,3,2020-09-19 10:38:30.044,Not so Starry,"Thank you in advance to the Amazon VINE program for providing an item to review. A positive review was not required, nor was it requested, and all words are my own.<br /><br />Getting my nails done is not just a relaxing experience, but it is also an expressive/creative one.<br /><br />Seeing this colorful and glittery set – I had to get it.<br /><br />I don’t know about others’ experiences – mine did not come with a brush or applicator for the little “gel pots”. I remembered what my nail techs used to use – small make-up brushes – and thankfully I had some. That seemed to work.<br /><br />The black polish is necessary to get the desired effect. I chose the purple glitter gel and after a few awkward moments – I got a pretty decent manicure. More of the black showed through, there were moments when the purple glitter reflected, but it wasn’t what I thought.<br /><br />I haven’t tried the other colors. But, this is fairly decent and easy to use. Not my favorite as there are other brands out there that are even easier to use.<br /><br />Overall, I’m not too unhappy with it. It’s not something I would likely purchase again.",0
AGROJMVDIUS3PBURBTV5MX5CVKSA,B08CCQ5NYJ,4,2020-09-19 14:01:48.622,Multi use silicone bottles with multi purpose accessories,"This is a nice set of 4 silicone travel bottles. They are soft and flexible. I am using them for hand sanitizer but you could use it for anything (like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, etc). So far there has not been any leaks but I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap. I usually turn the bottle cap side up for a few seconds so the contents are away from the cap before I open and then I turn it upside down to squeeze out. I like the retractable clip (it's essentially an identification badge clip or a keychain). Included are small carabiner clips which will allow you to hook the bottle to the retractable clip. It does look a little bulky with that setup but it works. At least you can use all 3 pieces separately if needed and it wasn't made for just one purpose. The bottles and retractable clips are individually packaged and then those items plus the carabiner clips are all packaged into a zip lock bag.",1

I like that it has organic ingredients since babies tend to be more sensitive still. It is itch-free and hypoallergenic as well. It also has oatmeal extract in it which is known to be soothing.<br /><br />It has a pleasant scent reminiscent of clean baby in my eyes. When you use this the skin feels moisturized afterwards without having used a moisturizer. But the skin does not feel greasy or oily which is great since I am not a fan of that feeling.  You also don’t need to use a lot of this in order to get the benefits of the product. And yes I admit, I actually like using this on myself. It just makes my skin feel great and look fantastic.",1

The combs teeth were bent on both sets and very flimsy. The thinning sheers appear to have either been used or just made really poorly. They ripped my hair all the way down, and the scissors were not aligned at all so I couldn't use them. The blades on all the tools were very ragged and just felt cheap.

The length on this hair is nice, but it's definitely thin like others have mentioned. And I'm not just talking about the bangs. The bangs are ridiculously thin — to the point where you would rather they hadn't given it bangs. It doesn't look at all like the product description photo. I have yet to color and layer this wig, but it would definitely be a backup option rather than a daily go to choice.",0

It does faintly smell of coffee but I had hoped there would be more of a spicy smell.  But, this is a nice feeling scrub against your skin.  It does make your skin feel energized.  I'm not sure how long it would take to make my cellulite become less visible but I will keep using it for the mere purpose that it does feel good.  I would say too that it would make a good gift because it's so unique.  I do recommend this product and for the price it's a good value for either a gift or keeping it for yourself as a treat.

It comes in a little pump dispenser. It is on the more inexpensive side of the spectrum. The design is in line with the rest of the product line. The moisturizer is pretty much fragrance free, it maybe has a hint of a fragrance that is pleasant but very subtle.<br /><br />The moisturizer itself is very lightweight. It absorbs very quickly into the skin and leaves no residue behind. You can instantly notice the difference between where you put it and where you didn’t. It mattifies the skin nicely and really neutralizes the oils in your skin nicely. I was rather impressed by that to be honest. My skin looked great, nice and matte but still moisturized. It felt smooth to the touch but looked good. All in all I was pretty impressed and liked how my face felt and looked when I use this moisturizer.",1

I was not sure what to expect to be honest, but I was pleasantly surprised. A lot of time when these shampoos contain tea tree and hemp their fragrance is not the greatest, but this one was shockingly impressive and really good. The fragrance of this one was actually really good and you can barely smell the tea tree which is great. I only smelled hints of it while it was on my hair.<br /><br />This shampoo produces a nice lather that wasn’t too rich but plenty to get my hair nice and clean. I didn’t feel like I needed a lot of it to get my hair nice and clean. I did let it sit for a couple of minutes to let it do “its thing”.  It rinsed out very easily and left nothing behind in my hair. My hair felt nice and clean and looked great. I followed up with a leave-in conditioner afterward still but my hair could have handled not using one after this shampoo. All in all I am very happy with this one and can recommend it.",1

This offers people the opportunity to play with both gel and polygel, while coming with a small light.  Being honest - when I first started working with gel I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, so a kit like this would have been super helpful.<br /><br />The gels themselves have nice self leveling.  The colors are nicely pigmented two coaters.  They are fairly tacky, so make sure you put on a top coat (which I always recommend) or be prepared to wipe down with alcohol.  They do take a bit longer to set, but they do set nicely.<br /><br />The sequins are a nice touch, and the top coat and base coats are very close quality to others I have (similar to Beetles).  The top coat isn't quite a no wipe, but it shines up beautifully with a little bit of alcohol.<br /><br />The tools are perfect, and the polygel colors are beautiful.  They set nicely, and file perfectly.  The duoforms are in lots of good sizes, so I don't have any issues finding the perfect sizes (my hands are weird, each finger has different size which is annoying to need 10 different sizes, but hey.<br /><br />I don't quite understand why there's the nail foils since there's no glue for the foils.  The top coat isn't quite tacky enough for foils.  The striping tape is a very nice touch.<br /><br />The light works fairly well.  The onyl problem is its a one button, so its only 45 seconds or 60 seconds.  I have a lot of other lights, so while I was happy to try this one out, and it'll be great for travel, I like my bigger lights for other  daily use.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great little kit for trying out gels and polygels.  I would advise that you pick up more files and a bigger light in the future with more settings and timers, but overall, this is great for getting started.  The travel case fits everything nicely, and makes it convenient to take on vacation.  The gels also last about 2 weeks which is a huuuuuge plus.",1

My biggest issue was with the glue. I had the hardest time trying to get my lashes to actually stick to the pad. It took a long time, and even then I had some that just refused to stay. All in all it probably took me an hour to do one eye (I’d strongly recommend doing each eye individually if you’re doing them yourself). The other recommendation I’d give is to watch some YouTube tutorials before starting. The instructions are bad, but they aren’t great and there are a lot of videos out there to help ensure you’re doing things correctly. Overall, my lashes were lifted and I’m fairly happy with the result. It wasn’t as dramatic as I hoped (you can see that with mascara my lifted lashes look the same as my curled lashes) but I do think it looks nice. If you’re looking for a cheap diy alternative to the salon I’d say try it out. But if you have the time and money, I’d opt for a professional service instead.",1

It went on like a mousse, kind of fluffy. I think thats what made it clump. It also clumped the lashes together besides leaving balls of mascara clumps on the lashes. I hoped for better based on the reviews, but it didn't go on nicely at all. It was sweatproof, yet it did smear over night just a bit. Honestly, it looked exactly the same in the morning as it did when I first applied it, besides the slight smudge under one eye. So I have to say, that's pretty bad to look like you slept in your mascara when it's been freshly applied. Big thumbs down on this one.",0

My daughter's hair is very straight and she needed lots of curls to wear with her halo hairpiece.  I curled both of them identically for a seamless look.<br />The curling iron heats up very quickly and you can read the temperature as it is rising.  The barrels do not have clamps.  You have to wrap the hair around the various barrels and hold it for a few seconds.  There is a heat proof glove that makes this very easy so you don't worry about burning your hands.<br />I had to use some heat spray and hold on my daughter's hair and it did not stick to the barrels.  I accidentally put it down next to a plastic bag.  The bag melted on the barrel but was easily wiped off with a tissue.  There is a straightening brush attachment that you can use as well.<br />The barrels are easy to fit into the handle: just line up the pins, push down and turn to lock them in place.  Where you push them in does not get hot so you can change out your barrels while you're doing your styling.<br />The cord on this unit is 6' long.<br />Great value for multi use curling wands.",1

What I LOVE about it is the delicious, robust coffee scent. It is STRONG and packs a powerful punch in the morning, which helps to wake me up. I also love the serious grit it has to it. The texture varies from fine grounds to courser grounds, with a higher ratio of course grounds. Each scrub feels like it's getting deep into my skin. I feel like I'm scrubbing off layers of dead skin, dirt, grime, etc. when I'm using this. My skin feels smoother and softer after I use this scrub. I apply lotion straight out of the shower and my body is soft as a cloud!<br /><br />What I sort of hate about this product is how messy it is. It just falls apart and gets everywhere. I included photos of what a hot mess my sink and shower look like after using it. Other scrubs I've used in the past have some agent that keeps them together to prevent it from going everywhere, but this doesn't. One I tried recently that I loved was JOON X MOON (https://www.amazon.com/Watermelon-Exfoliating-Moisturizing-Nourish-Essential/dp/B0876GX6MQ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=moon+cube+body+scrub&qid=1600826357&sr=8-2), and that is in cube form to start, then breaks down to scrub as you rub it and use water.  It does an incredible job of exfoliating without making a mess of my small shower. If you're not into the cube thing, I also like stuff that B&BW makes and they sell it on Amazon. It's has a paste-like consistency and does a good job at making your skin feel soft like a baby! Here is a Bath & Body Works aromatherapy scrub - I loooove this one: https://www.amazon.com/Bath-Body-Works-AROMATHERAPY-Eucalyptus/dp/B005LZUP36/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&keywords=sugar+scrub&qid=1600826921&sr=8-14<br /><br />The other thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the packaging. I have a tiny shower, so it is impossible to take anything in there without getting wet. Every time I take this into the shower, I'm nervous the bag will get soaked and ruin it. There is a waxy coat applied to the bag, which helps protect it, but it still doesn't give me as much confidence as something like a glass jar or tin would. Ideally, the scrub wouldn't get soaked until I'm ready to use it. It has held up through 3 uses so far but I may transfer it into a mason jar and store it that way.<br /><br />The other thing that really bummed me out was that is stained my clothes!!! I towel dried after shower, put on moisturizer, then light gray leggings. There must have been a tiny amount of residule coffee scrub because it stained my leggings!!<br /><br />Overall, a decent scrub to try. Not my favorite scrub, since it stained my clothes and made my shower a mess.",0

Now I don't know if this is just my hair being obnoxiously dry or not but that would be the only thing that I could say anything remotely ""bad"" about. The conditioning was just not quite enough on the ends of my hair. Great on the already healthy stuff, just seemed to ignore the drier ends. Figured I'd get that over with and move on to the good stuff.<br />This really gave my hair a nice shine to it. My hair is getting old with me and it no longer wants to be as manageable and tame as it once was. With this duo of delight my hair looked healthy after it dried. It looked good when left to air dry, when dried with the hot air brush, and when left to air dry. It looked shiny without the added matching shine spray (which is also a wonderful product) and with. I left out the word smooth in this so far but let me tell you! It was also smooth and sleek without having to use other products to make it stay that way. Granted, under all that grey old hair there has always been fairly thin straight hair so this just really put it back to looking like it used to in that regard. The shampoo cleaned it to the point of being squeaky clean as well.<br />Give this duet a try if you can. It works really well and smells alright to boot!",1

I tried it without it and the foundation settled in my lines. With the toner it stayed suspended well.  The foundations are a bit thick and it felt like I was painting my face on, but with a bit of work it blended nicely. The kabuki brush is soft and full. No bristles came off.

I was initially pretty frustrated the first time I tried to fill it with regular, thick gel hand soap because it wouldn't work. Then I went back and actually read the directions and found that this only dispenses LIQUID soap and hand sanitizer. It will not work with gels. If you want to use gel hand soap in it you will have to water it down until it's liquid. This dispenser is a sprayer, so it doesn't turn the soap into foam, and it doesn't work with gel soaps or sanitizers. If you're ok with only using liquid products then it works as advertised.",1

It is not too expensive at $25 since you get a nice sized bottle and you really don’t need a lot of this serum when you use it.

I've been using them to shape the recent hair cut I gave myself.  They are sharp and have a good weight to them.  I have not used the thinning shears yet so I cannot speak to them.  The other items in the kit are all pretty basic and cheap.  I gave the thin plastic combs to my daughter to use with her dolls.  The cape is thin and the strings in the back for tying seem flimsy.

They attach easily to any loop, whether it be a purse, belt, or backpack.  I really like the fact that the tops are interchangeable.  Ive never seen that options b4.  I also really like the funnel it comes with.  It doesnt take up much room b/c it collapses into itself for easy storage.  It is a little difficult to fill the bottles, even with the provided funnel.  The bottoms of the bottles are rounded, so u cant place them on the counter to fill them.  It CAN be done with one hand, but it is much easier to do with a 2nd person helping.  I dont like that they are made out of hard plastic.  It doesnt matter if u are just using it as a sprayer, but if u need it to be a squeezable bottle, it is difficult to get every drop out.  When u fill the bottle to use with the mister, u need to pay attention to the included straw inside.  It has to wrap around the area where the carabiner fits in order to get every last drop out of the container.  needless to say, I like this product's versatility, and especially during covid they r a great idea for hand sanitizer.  I hope this was helpful.",1

AF2AJZ2KIDH4QJSOXBKCFGAZITGA,B089ZQ8Y95,4,2020-09-26 13:09:46.051,"Excellent quality glass, ok nozzle, great color","The glass bottles are top notch - the glass is nice and thick, and the color is beautiful.  The ‘look’ of the bottle is so nice that it actually looks good sitting around anywhere (i.e. you don’t feel the need to hide it in a cabinet, under the counter, etc.).  The nozzle is ok.  It works well, and looks nice with the glass, but doesn’t feel particularly sturdy.  Having said that, it is far better than some others I have had where the nozzle sort of swiveled around while you were attempting to spray (VERY annoying).  There are two settings - a fine mist and a more narrow spray/mist.  Between the two settings you should be able to get the spray you want/need.  It also comes with nice blackboard style labels, two small funnels, and two screw on caps.  The caps are nice in case you want to better seal the contents for some reason - for example, if it won’t be in use for a while, packing it for a trip, etc.  Colored glass is needed for a number of liquids that you might have - peroxide, for example, or an essential oil blend.  The blue in these bottles is just really beautiful, and combined with the black sprayer, creates an attractive bottle so you will be pleased with both the functionality as well as the look.  This is the reason I chose these bottles because I use one of them to mix up a ‘spider repellent’ spray (water, peppermint oil, and a couple of drops of dish detergent), and it stays on the screened in porch.

Oddly, I don’t really notice the smell in the shower.  I love the exfoliation and use it on my entire body.  Out of the shower, I feel a mild oil barrier on my skin that I don’t care for.  Once I add my normal body shaping cream (Clarins Body Fit), I’m in heaven!  The 2 products together leave my skin super cool and tingly for about an hour, followed by crazy soft skin.  I don’t actually have a lot of cellulite (thank you Clarins!), but what I do have is less noticeable after just 2 uses.  So, what’s not to like?  This scrub is so incredibly messy, it’s borderline impractical!  Most scrubs are made with sugar or salt crystals held together with some form of oil or gel, and dissolve in the shower.  Ground coffee doesn’t dissolve and this scrub is dry, so it literally gets everywhere...like sand from the beach!  And worse, I have a walk in shower with white tile floors...coffee stains if it sits too long!  As much as I like the way this product smells and improves my skin texture, it’s a pain in my cellulite free backside to clean up!  Mixing it with a little water and creating a paste before use helps a little, and thankfully I have a handheld shower to quickly rinse it off my tiled walls and shower door, but I’m constantly concerned it’s going to stain my floor grout.

The price isn't cheap so he wanted to make sure to really look at everything as he used it. Here is what he had to say:<br /><br />""You have a pack of accessories here so I thought I would run through them in turn to tell you what you are getting and my impression of it<br /><br />Shampoo and body wash.<br />Okay, I ran through this way too quick and used all of it. It's good. It's really good and I couldn't really get enough of it. So that's a plus and a negative in that there isn't really a lot of it to begin with.<br /><br />Face wash.<br />I love to get In there and give my face a right good scrubbing. This helps. The wash is thick and gel like with the exfoliating, and it does feel like you have given your face a good scrub after use. You do feel cleaner after use.<br /><br />Shave cream<br />I'm not one for using cream very often. I prefer basic foam from a can. But wow. This stuff leaves your face feeling clean and fresh after shaving.  Not only that but incredibly soft.<br /><br />Moisture cream<br />This is really not something I use at all. I would think it best to use after shaving because you are stripping moisture from your face, but in that regard the shave cream is sufficient. I just don't personally have a need for a separate moisture cream. So it is sort of hard to form an opinion about it.<br />What I can tell you is that it doesn't really have a scent, my face does feel super soft. On the downside it is a little messy and I found myself wiping away the excess.<br /><br />For the most part then I really like this set. It comes in a handy pouch you can use long after the accessories are empty. However, that won't take too long because the bottles are very small. It's something for people who aren't concerned about the cost. It's very expensive. Is it worth the cost for me? Not really. Not in terms of either quality or quantity but if the price was lower I would be recommending to everyone.""<br /><br />There you go guys and gals. That's what he thought about the set.

It's smooth and doesn't bother me. The hand strap can be switched between sides so you can hold it on either side. I don't like the exfoliating side. Its too rough on my skin. It makes my skin sting even with the lightest touch. The loofah is also quite large for me to grip. I have a regular size hand and it can be hard to hold even with the band around my hand. The loofah holds a lot of water which makes it take awhile to dry even when I squeeze it at my hardest. Finally, the loofah isn't very flexible making it difficult to wrap around my body as I wash.",0

The material has a good strong feel, and it is large enough that it nearly feels like a washcloth. I can really get my hand on it. The packets easily tear open. The cloth, once wet becomes crazy sudsy. It has a barely there scent. I really have to sniff to be able to detect anything. Very fresh.  The lather is gentle and non drying. I was surprised that my face was not feeling parched or taut afterward.<br /><br />Not only for face, but it makes for a decent cleansing cloth to have a ""bird bath"" at the sink. Just wipe down everywhere you need to, rinse the cloth, rinse your body, rinse the cloth again, ring it out, use it to pat down the body.. and away you go.<br /><br />I think one could get away with using half a cloth easily for just face washing as there is plenty of cleaning agent in it.<br /><br />Overall it is a lovely product. I think it is perfectly packaged for occasional use, or for on the go/ travel. If I were to use it all the time, I would prefer something with less packaging. Maybe they have that... I didn't look.<br /><br />But for travel: definite yes. I would go so far as to use one in the shower to take care of face and entire body.

The silicone or plastic things to go behind your head all suck so I moved on to headbands.  My first try in headbands were ginormous and looked like I was wearing a skull or surgical cap...  Other headbands were a bit snug and sometimes uncomfortable - sometimes the buttons were too high and sqooshed the mask onto my nose.  I am now an expert in all these products. : )<br /><br />With that being said - THESE HEADBANDS ARE, hands down, THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!  I recommend you grab some and use them in good health!  The colors may be a bit bold - that is totally true.  But the fit and comfort is totally top notch.  Even with wearing my hair in a pony, bun, or twist these headbands stay securely on.  Yet you do not feel them at all - it is literally like WEARING NOTHING AT ALL.  No pressure on your head at all - sometimes when I close my office door and take my mask off, I actually have to reach onto the top of my head because I feel nothing and want to make sure my headband hasn't slipped off - and it never does!  The buttons are also in the perfect position where you can even put the lower part of the ear loop on your ear if you wanted.  The buttons are not too high like some other headbands.<br /><br />THESE ARE PERFECT!!!!  If I could scream it from the top of a building I totally would.  I am in love with these headbands and they are far superior to any others that I have tried - seriously and truly.  TOTALLY RECOMMEND!!!

If you travel a lot, or just want to keep one or two with you in your purse, you can do that and not have to worry about them drying up.<br /><br />All you do is remove it from the wrapper, dunk it quickly under running water and then squeeze.

We have been using both for water, but we are going to make one be an air freshener bottle using our essential oils.  After a quick test run with the oils, made extra convenient using one of the plastic filters that comes with each bottle, as long as they were diluted, the spray nozzle was able to provide an even and broad mist.  With two sprays in the playroom, it smelled like a citrus orchard, but didn’t leave the carpet feeling saturated.

While it is indeed a hands and body lotion, it targets especially dry skin areas-elbows, feet and heels. He has unbelievably dry , rough elbows and does so year round. He's always rubbing creams and lotions into his elbows with very little positive results. Until now. LA LA Leaf is softening his terribly dry, cracked elbows and doing so each time  he applies it. He has pretty much stopped complaining about his dry elbows, instead expressing  (nearly EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!) his excitement now that he has finally found a remedy.  lol.  While I ordered LA LA Leaf for him, I've now started to use it on my hands as well. Its lightweight, absorbs quickly and doesn't cause my skin to look or feel oily or greasy. Let me tell you, the hemp oil, rose flower water white bark extract , aloe (a fave of mine) ingredients do a heck of a job softening and smoothing my hands after I apply LA LA Leaf. I'm already planning on using extra LA LA Leaf in the winter when my hands get the dreaded deep, extremely painful cracks due to cold weather. I noticed in the info provided above, this lotion can be used after spending time in the sun. Because my skin is so terribly sensitive and dry, I do believe I will use LA LA Leaf after spending time outside in the sun when the weather gets warmer. Regardless of where you use LA LA Leaf on your body, its going to leave you with soft, smooth skin and will do so quickly.  I do believe LA LA Leaf is worth the cost. It doesn't take much lotion to cover the skin (in the areas we are using it on) so this tube is going to last us a decent amount of time. I have every intention of continuing to use/buy LA LA Leaf.

I was pleased to try Mr. Pristine's beard shampoo and so far I've been pleased with the results.<br /><br />First of all, it smells great.  None of the scents are overwhelming or powerful.  The faint mint is nice and refreshing.  Secondly, the lather is fine.  I noticed that if I apply some to my hair and work a lather, it's nice and frothy.  I then apply to my beard and give it a good cleaning.  If I apply the shampoo directly to my beard, the later is noticeably less frothy.  I don't know why this is.<br /><br />At any rate, it's been working well for me and leaves me feeling nice and crisp after a shower.  My only misgiving is the price, which is a bit steep for what you get, in my opinion.",1

I found though that this duo is not one of my favorites. In this pack you get a shampoo and conditioner that are basically travel size for $14. They are a bit bigger than you would get at a hotel for example so you get quite a few applications out of them, but for $14 I find this to be rather expensive to be honest.<br /><br />The bottles are pretty cute and look nice. When I used the shampoo I have to say I was disappointed by the fragrance. Usually this line has a fantastic fragrance but this one just wasn’t it. It produced a decent lather and rinsed out with ease. The conditioner had a similar fragrance in line with the shampoo. It was nice and soft and I did leave it in my hair for about 3 minutes I would say. It was easy to rinse out and left no residue on my hair. My hair overall looked ok once it was dry and was pretty soft but nothing impressive that would warrant spending $14 on this.

She has somewhat thick hair so I got her two different sets with multiple size curlers so that we would definitely have enough and have the right size. Neither set included any instructions, but it's common sense to know that the hair needed to be wet prior and it was easy enough to figure out how to apply the curlers. However, neither of us realized how time consuming the whole process would be. Half way through applying the curlers, my daughter started to get antsy and didn't want to sit there anymore. She also said that it hurt a little when pulling the hair through some of the curlers. We managed to finish getting the curlers in her hair, but by the time we were finally done she was just over it all. She was no longer willing to even wait for her hair to dry. So within about 10 minute she had starting pulling all of the curlers back out. Which that was another process. You have to be careful pulling each one out because if you start doing it too fast the hair will get tangled and stuck in the curler.<br />      I still think these curlers are nice though and I do think they would have looked great if she would have waited long enough, but they just weren't for her. I would recommend them for someone who doesn't mind being patient for the end result. For my daughter though we learned that it's just better to use a more quicker / instant method to curl her hair.",1

Yes and no.,"This mascara and eyelash curler combo has its pros and cons:<br /><br />The mascara - I actually really like this mascara, which I didn't expect, given the price and the cheap packaging it comes in. The formula is smooth and glides on easily, and the curled brush on the wand is dense enough and shaped just right to get every little lash. But most importantly, it stays on ALL day without running or flaking. I'd say it's pretty waterproof, but also comes off easily with eye makeup remover. I had a brand for mascara that I have been loyal to for years, but this is my new go-to in my makeup bag. And the price is great! My only issue with it is that it dries very quickly, so any mistake you make isn't going to budge. It also means that it's easy to make the lashes stick together if you don't apply it carefully.<br /><br />The eyelash curler - Actually I only have cons about this one. I hate it. It's shaped in a way that makes it difficult to use. The finger grips are set too far apart, making it awkward to squeeze, and the shape of the press is odd and it to angle my lashes into it. It's basically useless, and I tossed it in favor of my simple revlon lash curler.<br /><br />This mascara, however, I will be buying again!",1

Using these in the shower on my skin was one of the few moments of relief I had.  These contain a piece of loofa stitched very well onto a cloth pad with a piece of elastic over the back to keep on your hand. I didn't realize until recently that loofas are made from the dried insides of gourds. So, no, they're not a product of the sea like a sponge. It's amazing to me that they're able to be stitched so well into cloth.  I really like these. I just read that it's possible to machine wash loofa but that you shouldn't put them through the dryer. Eventually, my loofa got moldy from hanging out in the shower so often. I threw it away, but next time I'll know that I can put it through the washing machine before it gets to that state. Luckily, this is a 3-pack.",1

Altogether I got 1000 colorful ones and 1000 blacks ones. I got them for my 10 year old daughter and she loves them. They are more gently on the hair than most kinds , so they don't hurt as much to pull them out if we don't have scissors handy. They are also pretty durable. I seen other reviews saying that they break easily, but I literally tried to break one on purpose to see how far I could stretch it and it took alot to break it. Also, with the few that I stretched out, I thought that they would stay stretched out and that I would of had to throw them out. However,  after I let each rubber band go, it actually snapped back to the original shape and size. Another positive is that since there are so many , I was able to fill up two snack size ziplock bags (one colorful & one black) for my daughter to have to play with her dolls and make her rubber band bracelets. She still has plenty left to last a while for her hair. The next time we need to get more, these will be the only kind that I buy.",1

Little did I know that these would work and work well. I love the idea of the tiny funnel which helped make sure none of the oil spilled and went directly into the bottle. I like the little chalkboard like labels which I used on both bottles. I used to other bottle for my leave in moisturizing conditioner and it works like a charm. I have to be a little more careful with the bottles as they are glass and I'm not used to using glass spray bottles. The spray nozzle has the option to stop it from spraying and two ways it can spray, shower or stream. The bottles are very lightweight even after you add content inside of it.

I don't think it is something I could pull off for everyday wear.<br /><br />What I really don't like about this wig, is that on the top of the wig, right on the part, there is about 2 inches of hair that is cut super short. I included photos to show what I mean. When I put the wig on, these hairs don't wanna stay down. They stick out to the side, or up in the air. I really don't understand why it was cut that way. If they are trying to do baby hairs, they definitely did it wrong. The only hair that is cut is the darker brown part, which really makes it stand out against the blonde. I don't know what they were trying to do, but it doesn't look good.<br /><br />I will probably end up cutting those pieces off and hopefully it will look ok with them gone. Having a cowlick on the top of my head just isn't the look I am going for.<br /><br />The wig itself is on par with the price. It did shed on me a bit.

There was indeed some smell but it did not bother me and I did not even notice it unless I put it under my nose and sniff it. The pearls are secured at the other side by a small head pin head so I guess this makes it more durable. Been using this for a more than a month intermittently and it pretty held up well.

Saying that this is everything you need to make the nails if you have everything else. That means you already have the UV lamp, the base and top coat, and the solution and brush kit. From my experience, this kit is not for beginners. The glitter set aka starry sky set is messy and requires a lot of filing similar to biutees cat eye set. By hand, but filing with a nail drill is better. I was trying different looks to see if I can make some awesome looking Halloween (witchy) looking nails. This set alone is not it though.

It is a little on the oily side but the thing is now that the colder/fall/winter season is coming, this is the perfect face cream for the season. I would not recommend this for use during the hot summer but your skin will drink this up in the cold. The scent was light and pleasant, but that always comes down to personal preference as some people are very sensitive to smell.<br /><br />It says this cream has collagen and stem cells, but I’m not sure how much of those ingredients are used in the formulation. It would be nice to know because if there is too little then there is probably very little anti wrinkle benefits. As with all beauty/skin care products it takes time to see the results.

No sleep mode.,"Got this to save on my hand soap consumption since the pump soap dispenser dispenses thick liquid that is too much for one use. Placement and closing the battery compartment was really a struggle but was able to get it. The dispenser dispenses products in a quirt spray way. So a thick soap or sanitizer will not be able to effectively be dispensed. I dilute the hand soap with water as a solution. The canister can hold a lot and this is great as the dispenser is not too big nor too small. I usually take two dispenses to wash my hands. What I don't like about this is it does not have a sleep mode on to conserve battery life. It just keeps on with flashing light indicator. To conserve battery I have to push the switch button on and off before and after using the dispenser, which makes the touch free description not true. Price point is acceptable",0

So, I immediately thought that it must have broken in transit. Once I opened the amazon shipping package, there was a box inside. There wasn’t anything all over the box, so I opened it, and inside was a glass bottle completely intact. I couldn’t understand why the scent was so strong if the bottle was intact. Then, I thought if I can smell it that strong now, I wonder how it’ll be using it. The scent of the packaging had such a strong medicine kind of pepper smell, it was really overpowering.<br /><br />Inside the box, there’s a product info card. It has the product on one side with what benefits it’s supposed to have. The other side has specific instructions on how and when to use, and a full list of ingredients. I really liked that!<br /><br />The product comes in a glass bottle with a dropper. The bottle seems nice and durable. The product itself is a orange-yellowish color. I applied a little to the top of my hand and it felt oily. Someone in another review said it felt oily but they expected that since it was an oil. I’m not sure if they were talking about this product or another one. This is called a serum, so I don’t really expect it to be oily. I’m not sure if it’s some kind of serum, oil combo? I have dry skin so the oiliness wasn’t too bad for me. But, I could still feel it, so if I had oily skin I probably wouldn’t even want to use it.<br /><br />Anyways, the most use I could get out of it was the little I put on the top of my hand. The scent was so strong, it made me a little sick to my stomach. I’m not usually sensitive to smells, so it must have just been this specific scent - it had a medicinal, pepper type smell. I don’t really know how to describe it, but it wasn’t for me. So, unfortunately I can’t really say whether or not this is a good product. All I can say is that it comes in a nice glass bottle with a dropper, has a really strong scent, and it feels oily. If you’re sensitive to smells, I would say this isn’t for you.",0

I am using them for hand sanitizer but you could use it for anything (like shampoo, body wash, hand soap, etc). I wished there was an additional silicone anti-leak flap where the product comes out (like on certain ketchup or honey bottles) so the more liquidy contents doesn't flow right out when you open the cap.

It can also be reused as a regular wipe after the first use, just hang up and let dry. There isn't much of a scent, which is fine by me as strong fragranced wipes are bad for my allergies.

I have used many creams for my face over the years, but I think this is my favorite so far.  It is thick and moisturizes without being greasy.  It also saturates very well, and quickly.  I hate creams that you need to work into the skin for a long time, and this one is not like that at all.  I find that a little goes a long way, and so I just dab my finger in the jar, and put a few spots of cream on my face, then spread it around, and it seems like I hardly use any at all.

These panama jack ones do have SPF 45, and have a great flavor.  I think I have enough with this pack to last me a very long time, and that is a good thing.  My lips feel very hydrated, and the added sun protection for every bit of my skin is a huge deal.

And, of course, the stem cells would help address things such as diabetes and repair of heart muscle following heart attack, not zits on one's face. Not to mention that they would need to be live and 'human' cells. So, I am quite confident that the 'stem cells' claim is untrue and, even if it were true, the presence of dead stem cells in a cream would make zero difference.<br />Other than that, the cream is thick and, as other reviewer found, it has an aggressive smell that reminded me of Noxzema.

My ten year old daughter and I are recently new to doing nails with Gel polish. We really enjoy practicing doing each others nails. However, the first LED/ UV lamp that we got would get too hot for my daughter to be able to stand on her hands. So I decided to look for a different lamp. I had seen many of the reviews on this lamp that had said it was great to use with children. Plus it had mentioned that it included some accessories. Which made it a great value for the money. So I decided to give it a try. Now we have had it for a little over two months and it has been great. We use it quite often and it's pretty simple to use. You just put your hand inside, and it turns on right away or you can select one of the timed buttons. It cures all gel polishes quickly. My daughter has also been just fine using it. It hasn't gotten too hot for her at all, even when it's been on for a while. It also included some extras. It came with some profesional quality files, a cuticle trimmer, a brush, and a really awesome scraper tool that works so good at scraping the gel polish off.<br />          Furthermore, we are definitely happy with this lamp, and I don't think we will ever go back to regular nail polish that you have to wait for them to air dry.  I also plan on buying another one so that my daughter and I don't have to share just the one.",1

Bouquet Garni is double the size. That's a good thing. Less I've gotta get out. I'm not crazy about the White Musk smell. It's a floral scent. I'm more of a woodsy, fruity scent. On the other hand, my mother loves this scent. So, while I planned to use this as a shower gel, I've decided to use it in the guest bath.

It helps cut down on the inflammation from irritation and since it’s also an anti-bacterial it has helped control the acne, as well.  These are great to throw in your purse or keep in the car.  The glass is heavy & durable and the spray attachment screws down tight so they DON’T LEAK and the mist created is a nice, fine mist with zero “spitting” or errant streams.",1

It feels light, absorbs quickly and moisturizes my skin fairly well. This lotion leaves my hands and skin soft, silky and comfortable. I don’t feel my dry skin gets as much hydration as I get with my favorite premium body butters and creams, but those are heavier products so I don’t expect as much from a lotion.<br /><br />When applied after my shower, I get about 8 hours of hydration. That’s pretty good, though not the 24 hours claimed on the site. I do have dry skin and find this lotion hydrates better than most lotions. I’ve occasionally found one that gives me longer lasting hydration, but it’s uncommon. Excipial keeps my dry skin comfortable and itch free more like 12 hours but has chemicals such as parabens, while Guayaquil Hemp Lotion emphasizes organic and natural ingredients (but does have Phenoxyethanol).<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion feels gentle and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all. It doesn’t list chemical fragrance and is labeled fragrance free, which is a big plus as some fragrances trigger sensitivities for me. But it still may have fragrance. I smell a faint non offensive scent and don’t know if it’s from added “essential oil” (last ingredient) or just the natural scent of the natural ingredients.<br /><br />Guayaquil Hemp Lotion has 250 mg of CBD (THC free), which is still being studied but “may” hydrate dry skin and help inflammation. The ingredients look good but this lotion does have moderately risky (per EWG) Phenoxyethanol in the top ten ingredients and drying alcohol in the bottom 5.

When it comes to the gels alone: they have a very nice smooth texture that is easy to manipulate and use.  They fill the dual forms nicely, but also are able to move and smooth well enough to use the nail extension wraps instead.  The have enough give in them to allow for some self leveling, and dry easily in about 60-90 seconds a side (I always dry under LED on the top then flip the finger and get the underside of the extension just to make sure it solidifies perfectly).  Once dry, they are able to very nicely file down and smooth in place, which is great considering some are truly jam backed with various sized glitters.  They need a good wipe down with alcohol after cooking though, having a fair amount of tacky surface, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The cremes are fairly solid in color, and opaque.  I love the various pinks, and the white is a nice solid color that isn't too harsh making it perfect for a nice soft french tip.  The #03 pink is a great neutral and classic pink color, which is great for either a base color for extensions or for turning into a french tip with the white.<br /><br />As for the glitters, they are nice and shiny.  My only complaint is I wish the matrixes had a touch more color added to them.  The various colors of glitters make it clear what the effect/color  should be, I just think they would pack a bit more punch if there was a bit more dye in the matrix.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice set.  Keep in mind, all the bottles are small except for the #3 pink.  But its a nice little starter kit, and the glitter is a nice addition.  I'll definitely keep these in mind going forwards!",1

So, I constantly am using makeup wipes to wipe the swatches off of my arms. These work good for that. I wouldn’t use them on my face because, while they’re wet enough to wipe the swatches off my arms, I need to rub more than I do with my usual wipes. Given that, I wouldn’t want to use them on my face where I’d need to rub hard, pulling my skin. It’s not good to use makeup wipes to remove your makeup anyways, since it can tug at your skin and because they usually don’t remove all of your makeup. I still sometimes like to use makeup wipes to wipe the majority of my makeup off, then go in and cleanse my face. But, again, I just wouldn’t use these for that.

But this body wash altered my perspective a bit. One small pump of this body wash covers your entire body. Is that not cost effective or what? The consistency of the soap it self is very dense and thick and not droopy and watery like most body washes out-there. The smell lingers for a few hours until you bathe again so its like wearing a perfume without a perfume (if you like the scent of course). The foam is also very rich if using this soap with a sponge. Sadly, everything about this product on the label (beside the name) is in Korean. But would totally recommend and acquire again in the future.",1

I ordered this cream to help moisturize his dry skin as well as  reduce his fine lines as he approaches the 'big 5-0'.  He's not yet noticed a reduction to his fine lines though he hasn't been using the lotion very long but he is pleased with the job its doing to help moisturize his skin.  His skin isn't nearly as dry as it had been so he is experiencing some much needed relief.

The first time I purchased one on the market was because I was adamant about returning It if I wasn't 100%, except it did work just like they said. I will not go without it now. It gives you moisture without a heavy oil type of effect. It appears to draw in exactly what your skin needs to balance. Yes, it is that good. Hope it works out as well as it did for me.",1

Unlike any BB cream I've ever tried!,"The Fromnature BB cream by Cosmocos is unlike any beauty balm I've ever tried. It has much better coverage, and a thicker consistency than any other BB's I've used (which, until now, have all been Western brands). It almost covers like a foundation, but feels extremely lightweight like a BB. It does dry down really fast, and it was a bit darker than I expected. I am light neutral in complexion and chose the shade ""light beige"". I believe I was able to make the color work for me, but I'm not sure if it'll suit all light skin tones. 👻<br /><br />This BB has a beautiful satin matte finish, but did have a tendency to cling to my dry patches, so be sure to start with an exfoliated, well moisturized, and primed face. I did not use any primer with this product, (since it's marketed as a BB cream), and without the aid of a pore filling primer this product did eventually settle into my fine lines & large pores. I am really impressed with the staying power of this product though, even without primer & setting spray! After a full day of masking against covid in the South Florida heat, there was no transfer to my face mask. 😃 That's a huge, HUGE plus! With that being said, I highly recommend using a really good cleanser to efficiently remove this product at the end of the day.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Great coverage that can be built up<br />+ Very lightweight on the skin<br />+ Excellent staying power<br />+ SPF 50<br />+ Transfer resistant! 🙌<br />+ No photo flashback!<br />+ Fragrance free!<br />+ 1.67 oz of product (vs. the U.S. standard 1 fl. oz)<br />+ 2 sample hair care products included as a bonus! ❤<br />+ Convenient PRIME Shipping<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Dries very fast and can be difficult to blend<br />- Clings to dry patches<br />- Settles into pores & wrinkles (without primer)<br /><br />TO BE CONSIDERED:<br />* Warm yellow undertone may not suit everyone<br /><br />Side Note: There was one other thing I wanted to mention... When I took the manufacturer safety seal off of the tube, I had a volcanic eruption of BB cream that I wasn't prepared for, which made a mess of my tube. If you're like me and don't want to waste precious product, just be aware that it might come spilling out like lava when you break the product seal. 🙃",1

This Nano version is basically the same as the Original version but cut up into smaller pieces. The loop size and thickness of the curl is exactly the same as the Original but with just a smaller circumference. I have small fingers (ring size 4.5) and it was impossible for me to even tie it a second time with this in a half updo. If they had taken their Slim version, shortened that and thinned out the thickness in that then I think it would be perfect as a smaller tie like the Nano. Their Nano version should keep the same circumference but have more loops but at a smaller loop size and less thickness. Luckily I was able to get this refunded on Amazon.",0

Very moist.<br />  - mask doesn't rip or tear<br />  - plastic backing for easier application<br />  - gentle, pleasant aroma<br />  - sinks quickly into skin after massaging at end<br /><br />Cons: - thin<br />  - hard to slide into place...and then doesn't fit quite right<br />  - suggested wear time is 20-25 mins....longer than usual<br /><br />These masks come individually packaged in robust and easy to open pouches. The mask has a sturdy, plastic backing, which is the only reason it can be unfolded and placed on without any trouble because these are thin. Surprisingly, they don't rip or tear easily, though. After taking off the backing, it takes a little maneuvering to get these to sit in place. Firstly, the thin material wanted to bunch and roll along the edges of the face, and the lack of thickness made it difficult to get to lay flat. Also, the eye holes aren't quite right. I, my son, and my daughter tried them (each with very different face sizes) and all of us had trouble with the eyes. When they were in position, The bridge of the nose wouldn't stay pressed against the skin, but kept lifting up. The suggested wear time is 20 to 25 minutes, which is longer than the 15 to 20 I normally see on masks. Removing the mask, however, is no problem, and there's a good amount of moisture left over to massage into the skin....which also works well<br /><br />The masks are moistening and have a gentle, pleasant odor (although I can't really place it). These are refreshing and leave the skin shiny. If only they'd sit better, I'd enjoy them more.",0

You can really create the design that fits your style.<br /><br />There are directions on each sheet of butterflies, although the directions are the same for all of them. The directions are easy to follow even though they aren't always grammatically correct.

With younger children, picking nail polish is a given, so despite the gel’s potential to last for up to two weeks, they manage to remove it in just a few days.  For them, though, it means another nail session and new colors, so no big deal.  The gel nail polish was hopefully our answer to increase the duration and longevity of their finished nails.<br /><br />Anzuo Gel Nail Polish offers attractive color kits.  We received the Kit 3 set, which contains black, red, white, and three shades of tan to brown.  Like others have commented, the lids only contain numbers, and the kit includes stickers where the user has to create the swatches.  This is an inconvenience, but not the end of the world.  We found it to be a good test to see how the gel polish would actually apply and then finish.<br /><br />The gel was rather thick, even after keeping it at room temperature, and rolling it to ensure sufficient mixing.  With thinner and increased coats, the polish results in deep, beautiful colors that we really enjoy.  The white looks like white-out, even with a top clear coat, though.  The black and red are the favorites in our home.<br /><br />The main problem we experienced and shared with others is the inconsistency and deficiencies in the product’s marketing.  There are typos, poor translation and grammar, and worse yet, is the inconsistency in the cure times advertised by the company on the Amazon site and the actual shipping box.  The box says cure time is 10-30 seconds by LED/UV lamp, but the website says time frames up to 120 seconds.  That is a huge difference that seriously impacts the quality and life of the nail finish.  We cure using time frames of 60-120 seconds, depending upon the wattage used by our lamp.  With these longer cure times, we have been able to keep the polish looking well and intact for over a week now, even on our children’s nails.<br /><br />If you can overlook the need to label the bottles, disregard the spelling and grammatical errors, and then utilize your own cure times, the Anzuo gel polish is worth using.",1

The lashes themselves are really thick and nice looking. Not sure if I’ll be able to reuse them or not. I’ll definitely have to order more lash glue to even be able to use all the other lashes.

I ended up washing it... there was so much dye in the sink..the water was darker than this... like, Black when I started washing it. I was running water the whole time I was washing it so the water looks like a light purple but it didn.t start that way, the water was nearly jet black at first.<br />With that said,..I like the band around it..it.s big and spacious as well.<br /><br />Update...i.ve had to wash it again and again as the stains were still getting on my white pillowcases. The dye for this thing is really strong as it doesn't wash out easily.  It can.t be all that safe having that dye seep into your scalp which, seeps into your body/system.<br />I don.t sleep in it anymore...I just wear it during the day at home when I want my hair out of the way. I ended up buying a white one and that 1 works better for me.",1

And used the white (which is the mostly iridescent  one) on my four year yeah old over her eye shadow for Halloween as well. It just was absolutely stunning!

I'd never seen anything like it and it seemed like a real powerhouse for people with skin issues. I loved the fact that it comes in a bag with many smaller bars of soap so I could basically use a fresh bar of soap pretty often - people often don't think about how ""dirty"" soap gets!<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it didn't seem to be quite as effective as the other soaps I've tried for my skin despite most of the ingredients being ones that I know help. I think my skin didn't respond all that well to the glycerine in the soap too maybe. I don't think I'll be getting it myself but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to people with a less sensitive system.

There was another reviewer who said how nice they looked - like Swarovski crystals - more high end.  Her description was great and her photos were good - but the photos are nothing like the actual headbands.  They look soooooo much better in person.  They really do look like lovely high end bands.  I was surprised how nice they look on - in real life.  In the box - you are like - they are OK.  But once on - WOW!<br /><br />Now they do not grip the head or hair really - sort of loose on top of my head but they are secure on the sides.  I didn't feel like they were coming out or anything.  They are relatively comfortable to wear as well.  BUT they will not really hold your hair well - either.  These are really just for looks mostly - which is fine with me as they REALLY are pretty.  Are they perfect - no - on two of them the beads are spaced a bit here and there - in your hair you won't even notice, though.  Plus they come in a variety of colors.  I can wear up to three and make it look cute.<br /><br />I guess you could wear these with jeans and a tee for some pizazz and more of a girlie look - but they really are pretty enough for special occasion events and parties, and stuff.  Especially in low light situations - the crystals catch the light and look really lovely!<br /><br />If you find this review helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button?

The color is beautiful but lighter than expected. But I was so disappointed in the construction of the wig. If you look at the picture of me you can already see the weft showing through the bangs. Then when you just lift up the side if the wig you can how badly made the wig is. It is like this from the ear up to the top of the bangs.

It is made if microfiber and is soft as blankets. The turban is great for just throwing your hair in there, while the hair towel wraps up nicely and has a good button and band on it to hold it in place. The two hair ties are nice, but not needed. Still useful though! The towels themselves absorb all of the water and hold it in place. So, once you take the towels off, they are soaked for hours, unlike your hair.

It wasn't too tight around my head and held everything together but I wouldn't want to wear it for extremely long periods of time. I didn't have to worry about my wig flying away because it was too windy outside. Moving my head around while it was on took a little adjusting to but after about 30 minutes I was fine and forgot I even had it on. What I really like about this is that I don't have to worry anymore about the back of my own hair getting clipped or stuck on the installed wig clips and elastic latch. I have this issues even with regular wig caps. The band prevents that from happening which is a plus for me because the latch can sit over the band.,1

I do like the packaging.  its nice and bright and easy to find at the bottom of ur purse.  I think the box it comes in is a waste of money on the company's end.  its a cube that measures about 3.75"" x 3.5"" x 4.25"".  it has 10 yes 10 prepackaged wipes inside.  they could have easily been compressed down to a smaller package, which would in turn made it more eco friendly.  so in conclusion, im a Prius owner who only cares about the price of gasoline, and these r just way to expensive for me to actually purchase... especially during a pandemic where people r loosing their jobs left and right.

Also, it's one of my favorite scents - Lavender!  This bar is rectangular with rounded sides, and is heavy and substantial at 5 oz.  It's a creamy white color, with a strong and wonderful scent of Lavender and Bergamot, which is a citrus.  Bergamot is also used in my preferred special tea of Earl Grey, so it's very familiar.  I used this nice soap in my morning shower and was pleased that it produced a lot of rich lather and suds, and it left me feeling super clean.  Listed in it's ingredients is a mixture of Palm oils that are from certified growers of this product, and it contains Shea Butter that helps keep the skin moisturized, and Argan oil that's good for a comfortable and soft feel on the skin.  The citrusy Bergamot and sharp Lavender flowery scent hung on for a while.  It should be great for either sex, with that nice pure and clean smell.

Bottle size is average from other brands I have tried (usually between 6-8 ml), these bottles contain 7.5 ml. Gel is thicker that most brands, which is kind of good and bad at the same time. Good because you can get a great coverage with 2 thin layers. However, it is a little more difficult to apply, especially the white one that is super thick, but you will get a perfect white!<br /><br />Like any other set that does not come with base and top coat, make sure to get them before trying to use this nail polish on its own. They won't last if not using base and top coat.<br /><br />Not a fan of bottles that do not include the sticker with the color, just the number, so you either apply it to the bottle and cure them or get some nail watches, cure them and have them handy when choosing colors.<br /><br />I have not tested the durability of them (it would depend a lot of the quality of your base and top coat and how well you prep your nails).

AGSVNZDZNPCMXG5DEFXMZNRH2LCQ,B08GYJY8F2,5,2020-11-08 04:29:25.483,"Nice masks, nice results!","I’ve tried several different Karuna masks...they’re all good, but some are better than others.  This particular set is a great mix of masks designed to help with different needs, including hydrating, soothing and brightening.  The masks are individually wrapped and presented in a box that opens like a book, with suggestions for which masks to use on which days.  The packaging is nice and these would make a great gift.  The masks are very saturated (overly saturated, IMO) with serum, with plenty left over to use on my neck.  They’re large enough to easily cover my entire face, and come with a paper backing that makes them easy to to unfold.  Because they’re so saturated they easily slip while on my face, which makes it impossible to do anything other than sit still for the 20-30 minutes I wear them.  Also, there’s so much serum left on my face after I remove the masks, it’s impossible for my skin to absorb it all.  I’ve discovered that lightly splashing my face with cold water helps remove the excess serum and my skin fully dries more quickly.  Ultimately, all of the face masks left my skin very soft and hydrated, and a few of them plumped my skin and created a lovely even skin tone.  There is one set of eye masks in the kit and that that were surprisingly light and effective, reducing puffiness and brightening my eyes.  These are a tiny bit pricey, but they’re a nice quality and I like having a set of masks that cover a range of needs.",1

Normally masks claim to do a lot and often I'm left let down, that was not the case with this mask. These have a TON of moisture/liquid/balm whatever youd like to call it. I was able to apply it to my face, and it was completely saturated so I decided to rub a good amount on my neck, and then once getting it in place I rubbed it into my hands. The serum I rubbed down my neck did dry a lot faster and got sticky in the crease of my neck. I left it on for 25 minutes and it absorbed extremely well. My face is so hydrated without feeling oily. It was so refreshing while I had it on, it was cooling and helped me relax. The directions say to rub the remaining serum in after you take the mask off, which I did. But it was too much serum to leave on and I felt sticky. So I wet my face and wiped the excess with a towel. The only complaint I have is that the mask is weirdly thin and I had a hard time placing it on my face correctly. The eye holes were hardly big enough and it got my lips wet. I think this has to do with how I put it on but I think they could still be a little bit larger in diameter.",1

The scissors are made out of stainless steel but when using them you will notice that they wont cut as smoothly compared to more expensive higher quality scissors. The shears worked perfectly fine for me and they did the job well.<br /><br />Everything else provided in the package is more like the 3 star hotel freebies that are cheap and poorly made. The cape is only good for a few times before it will most likely rip apart and the combs provided were bend on arrival.",0

The crescent shaped patches are creamy and smooth. I popped this thing on my face for 20 minutes and it hadn’t dried out by the time I finished using it. I love that. It makes me feel like the product is going to do its job hydrating my skin. After removing, my skin looked plump and soft and the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth looked greatly diminished. The essence takes a few minutes to sink in and the finish is a tiny bit sticky on the face and heavy around the patches, but I don’t mind that at all. Again, I feel like it’s doing its job. The essence plays well under other products and doesn’t cause any pilling. Upon waking the day after use, my skin looked so smooth and dewy and the fine lines still looked filled in a bit. I was very pleased with this mask and will definitely repurchase after running out.",1

There are 6 little soaps in a package, and are a modernized teardrop shape, a shield design, making it easy to hold while using.  The soap actually produces a good amount of a creamy, sudsy lather, and leaves the skin very clean and soft with a nice amount of moisture.

I finally decided to try them. These things exceeded my expectations by far! The first time I chose the not so dramatic ones but they were thicker than my own. They did great. They were only a tad heavy. They stayed on 8 hours but I took the eyeliner with me to work and touched them up. I honestly think they would’ve stayed on longer if I hadn’t have forgotten and put regular eyeliner on first out of habit. I do wish this came in another color besides black as I have blonde hair and it’s dramatic. But once I wore them a while I realized it looked good. After work, I removed them easily. My eyes were itchy a little but when I woke up that evening they were back to normal. Another reason I think they didn’t stay on 12 hours was instead of following directions, I read somewhere that a person put the eyeliner on the the lashes while still wet and it worked better. The next night I followed directions. Put a coat on let dry then add another coat. Honestly, it pretty much dries by the time you finish both eyes. Don’t forget to shake it up though. They were very easy and quick to do. The only real time it takes is deciding which ones to use as there are so many nice selections. I realized the ones I thought were too dramatic when choosing actually look the best. I’ve gotten o many complements. And this time they stayed on all night. I think I could sleep in them and they would stay on. I wouldn’t though. The corners might poke your skin on inner eye when you close them but this can be remedied by snipping a tad off with scissors once you try them on and see how they do. I didn’t have to trim mine. Also, I had put a pair on and decided I liked the longer ones better so I took off the first ones and applied the others. I never redid the eyeliner. They still worked and stayed on. There’s magnet particles on eyeliner and the lashes are on a magnet strip. They are easy to remove but stay on like they are real. That sounds crazy. I didn’t want to ruin my own lashes with the glue kind plus I can’t get them on good enough without adjusting them. These you can take off and adjust. This gave me confidence I lacked in doing this. Plus, my hands aren’t that steady. When removing, start at corner and peel off. They won’t hurt your lashes. To remove eyeliner I used cold cream. It worked well. Just water doesn’t work. It is waterproof very much so. So cry all you want with these lashes ladies. You won’t have to worry about them falling off.

It is great that the sprayer bottles can be attached to something, as there is less chance of dropping and losing them while travelling.  Note that since the sprayer cap isn’t attached and can be still lost.<br /><br />This bottle can be used for gel / cream or liquid to spray. The sprayer tube extends to the bottom of the bottle near the narrow carabiner attachment hole, so you can spray until almost the last drop. The sprayer has been working well.

It can take off your edges and make a mess on your head when you sweat. I try to avoid it less and less due to this.<br /><br />I am a fan of wearing my wig naked because of those issues, but I am glad that there is a more natural alternative now. I never knew these existed or I would have tried them much sooner.<br /><br />This set came with a transparent clear wig band and a tan one. I mostly wear the tan one because it blends better with my lace. But, putting it on is very easy and it has a decent tightness. It grips well, but not enough to be super tight.<br /><br />The band is very stretchy and easy to maneuver. Yet, it has a decent thickness as well. The bubble like grips really help it do its job well. Very durable and strong plastic bands overall.<br /><br />The band, plus the combs in my wig makes my wig very secure and tight. I haven't had any issue with it slipping or sliding back without me having to move it no matter what I'm doing. When I'm sweating it doesn't move and it fits my head very well overall.<br /><br /> So, I am super glad to have found this. This was a great investment for those that don't prefer glue all the time<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest and unbiased reviews. Thanks for reading:)",1

The twist towels always hurt her ears and since I wash her hair in the shower, getting her towel wrapped head in a tee shirt could at times be difficult.  The turbine is easy on her ears and comfy all over. It isn't bulky making it easier to get dressed with it on after a shower.<br />I use the wrap towel and it works great. Really soaks up the excess water. The button and elastic loop are sturdy, they don't feel like they will fall off or snap from regular use. The scrunchies are a bonus. They too are soft and velvety.

Second picture is to just show that this white is really an off white, milky white. Third picture is 2 days later where 2 popped off. The next day the ring finger one broke in half. 🤦🏻‍♀️ This is my 7th set(of different sets and brands of polygel trying to find the best). Not my first rodeo. I know what I’m doing with polygels. Am I a professional? Nope. Just a mom doing my own nails at home. I love polygels as it gives me beautiful salon nails from home and can stand the abuse a regular mom can put it through (like cleaning and washing dishes without gloves,etc).<br /> I tried 4 different colors. They gave me an insight about the quality of this set. You only see 3 colors in the first pic, I know. But that’s because the clear is what I originally tried ( I really did try) to put on my middle finger instead of one of the glitters. Putting this set in the forms(I don’t use the forms from this set as I don’t like them), using solution to spread it in the forms was like any other polygel I’ve used. It’s when I turned it over and put it on my nails did something different happen. It basically started to ooze out of the forms way more than normal,it was getting messy. Putting it under the uv lamp to set it quickly. But as it was setting under the lamp the nails were falling a bit and setting that way. But it was the “clear” color that was the worst of the bunch. Oozed out so fast that it was un-salvageable. The way it oozed made me think of Buitee’s Starry sky set. But at least those were the specialty set, their regular ones were SOLID(even if I didn’t like some of the colors, that’s nothing on their quality). This set will probably work on nails like polish or something, but I love using the nail forms and this just doesn’t work, and didn’t stay ON. I don’t recommend this.",0

With it on, the foundation doesn't settle much, but it still looks cakey unless you put barely any product on. At that point, it's pretty sheer and doesn't do much.<br />I liked the shades, and was able to match my skin tone by mixing the two.<br />The brush that comes with it is also pretty useless.

When I saw these up for request, I clicked right away.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not that happy with these. I do like the design of the package-the plastic cover that clicks closed. (Resealable ones I've used in the past don't stay resealed because the adhesive wears off over time.) Trying to get one of the wipes out was difficult, because it doesn't seem like the slit is begin enough to pull them out. Once I got the first one out, though, it did become easier.<br /><br />Most days, I'm only wearing eye makeup lately, because I'm always wearing a face mask at work and a lot of foundation rubs off on those. For waterproof mascara, these wipes do NOT remove it all, AND you have to wipe pretty darn hard to get anything off at all.<br /><br />Look, I'm a maturing woman, I don't need to be rubbing and rubbing and rubbing around the area of my eyes. No, these don't contain anything that irritated by eyes, but I feel like I'm rubbing my skin OFF-that's how much pressure I had to apply.<br /><br />These might work better at removing foundation, but since I'm not bothering with that right now, (because..face masks), I'm only reviewing these for how they remove waterproof mascara and that answer is just barely....okay.",0

I also prefer the cheapies only because I am not sure if the recipient will definitely use it, and the higher end masks tend to be more discerning in what it attends to.

AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,B08GJJ5RV9,3,2020-11-12 23:30:05.093,"Refreshing cucumber face mask, unpleasant texture","When I pulled the first of these masks out of the package, I didn't think that it would fit on my face at all. Mainly, because the eye holes were only about a centimeter wide, and the mouth hole was literally just a slit in the plastic. However, once I pulled off the plastic sheet that helps the mask keep its shape in the package, I found that these holes stretched, so it ended up working out okay, though I would still like for the eye holes to be a little bit longer as they barely fit around my eyes. Overall, because of the material / stretchiness of the mask, this fit my face better than a lot of other sheet masks do.<br />The main reason I'm giving only three stars is the feel of the mask itself. When I first touched it, my immediate thought was that it felt like a donut that sat in a pool of water for several hours and ended up being soggier than anyone should have to even imagine (trust me, I worked at a donut shop for years and this accidentally happened sometimes). My husband's reaction was that it felt like boogers. After taking it off and inspecting it a little more closely, we both thought it pretty much looked and felt like soggy toilet paper. Whichever answer you got with, it's not at all pleasant to touch, and not a pleasant texture moving around on your face either. Once you get it on, as long as you basically hold still and don't talk or anything, then it actually has a nice cooling, refreshing feeling. And it smells wonderfully like cucumber, which is what I was really hoping for!<br />The other reason I'm giving three stars is because it left my face feeling sticky for a long time after I removed the mask. Some masks leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes, but this one took almost two hours to absorb into my skin because it left so much. With other masks I don't normally help this along, so I didn't with this one either. When it finally did absorb, I was happy with how my face felt... I'm not against getting this mask again especially for the price because I did really like the cooling sensation in particular, it's just not one I'd get / use too often because of the gross, soggy feeling of the mask itself.",0

Instead of a pump or squeeze bottle, this comes out though as pressure aerosol - also just like a mousse or shaving cream.  The ingredients necessary to make this happen are Butane and Propane. They are aerosol propellents.  If you have ever used mousse, hair spray, various perfumes/body sprays, air fresheners, aerosol deodorants, or shaving cream,etc..  then you are already familiar with these ingredients. They are generally recognized as safe, and are used in small, diluted quantities in skin care. Fun fact, ""These ingredients are used in cosmetics and personal care products as a replacements for chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC propellants, some of which have been shown to have negative effects on the environment"".  I'm not a big fan of slathering my body with butane, propane, or isobutane, but I understand their use in this type of medium. So it's up to you to decide.<br /><br />This company does have non aerosol body wash available too..<br /><br />The resulting foamy wash comes out thick, it is creamy. Because it reminds me so much of a shaving cream, that it what I have been using it for. Then whatever is left over I use on rest of body. Is pleasant smelling enough to me but it isn't quite a pure aromatherapy experience for me. Clearly it uses a variety of essential oils- rosemary, orange, eucalyptus, peppermint, limonene. However, for whatever reason, it contains ""parfum (fragrance)"" as an added ingredient. As well as Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, another synthetic fragrance ingredient. Is there not enough naturally occurring scent from the use of essential oils? I think the added synthetic fragrance is redundant and takes away from the olfactory experience.<br /><br />As an actual wash, it is fine.<br />3 stars-- this is just a middle of the road rating.  I am not in love.  The experience is underwhelming. I am much too quickly going through the container. Aromatherapy experience is a little off  as I pick up on something other than essential oils. Otherwise the cleansing action is fine. But.. I likely won't repurchase.<br /><br />I think if I really want a foam wash, I will just use another body wash or make my own wash and pour into a foaming soap dispenser.<br /><br />CRUELTY FREE  |  NO PARAFFIN, SILICONE OR MINERAL OILS  |  PLANT-BASED | PARABEN FREE  |  VEGAN<br /><br />Aqua (Water), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Butane, Glycerin, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Isopropyl Palmitate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil, Mentha Aquatica Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Benzyl Alcohol, Geraniol, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Sodium Levulinate, Sodium Anisate, Parfum (Fragrance), Hydroxyethylcellulose, Sorbitol, Propylene Glycol, Glucose, Propane, Isobutane, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide",0

If you have longer hair and just want some twist towels, I would go with a different product because the cap probably won't work for you.

As expected, it doesn't stop perspiration since it's not an antiperspirant, but most of the time it didn't bother me. The stick is a little harder than typical deodorant, but it applies fine after holding it to your skin for a few seconds. I don't feel like I have to use as much as I would with other products. Unfortunately, after I used this product for a while I started noticing that I was getting rashes where I use it. I'd use my old product for a few days and it would go away, but the rash returned when I used this product again.

I tried it first on the inside of my elbow to make sure I didn't have any negative reactions to it and I got hooked from the first smell. I've gotten a few compliments about the smell being nice and others wanting to know what perfume I'm wearing. Be careful not to spray too much so it's not overwhelming and honestly you don't need to spray that much for it to last. I also like the bottle and the tassels around it. Very well designed bottle and in my favorite color so that was a plus. It was also packaged very well too.

They take glue very well and very easy to clean (I just pick the glue off them). These are definitely reusable which is honestly my favorite part about them.<br /><br />The lashes offer slightly different sizes within their packs so please look before you pick. My only complaint is that it’s hard for me to tell which lash goes to with which lash because of the placement of the lashes.

It seemed like it was doing a good job then then the flakes came right  back so it was very surface  and didn’t penetrate. Then I’ve had very thick moisturizer  like the one you use at night. The problem with this is sometimes it made like little balls. I’m not sure how to describe it but it kind of made a layer and then peeled  off. So I needed something in between. This wa a perfect.

When still damp from a shower, I rub the oil on my skin and it moisturizes much better than any type of lotion that I have tried.<br /><br />These oils also make wonderful body scrubs using essential oils for scent and sugar or salt for the exfoliating.

Since I don't travel much anymore, I felt a bit nostalgic when I saw this bag of six soaps. Each one is tear-shaped and about the size of a hotel travel soap. I really like the scent and it lathers well - best of all it's made without the toxic chemicals most mainstream soaps and body washes are filled with. It has a refreshing scent, thanks to being made with essential oils.<br /><br />It's advertised as a soap that ""boosts immunity"" but I find that laughable - everyone is reminded constantly to wash your hands as a way to prevent the spread of COVID and that action, you could say, ""boosts"" your immunity given that COVID is no match for soap. But to say the soap gives you some immunity is a bit of a stretch. Except for this questionable marking slogan, I liked these soaps.",1

I don't know if this is because of how they were packaged, (which was a very secure packaging), that caused some of them to widen.  This is a problem for me beauty I already have issues with headbands sliding back with my egg/oval-shaped head, so a wide headband will most certainly slide off.<br />Aside from these two minor issues, the headbands are great.

I love these to bring to travel. They are small and super handy. I used to bring some face wipes but I find that those dont actually take off all your makeup!

It has the same appearance as the tube of foundation - black with white wording. There’s also a little rectangle in the shade, with the shade number and name. The product packaging looks nice. It comes with a product card saying they love to hear from you and 2 samples for hair products (which I thought was odd for hair products with foundation, but whatever 😂) - 1 for “RG II Hair Loss Clinic Premium Shampoo” and 1 for “Sohair Morocco Argan Oil Hair Essence.” I didn’t try either of the samples so can’t say anything for how those work.<br /><br />The foundation comes in a squeeze tube. When you twist off the main top, there’s a protective seal. I usually like pumps with my foundations. But, I don’t mind this being a squeeze tube. It isn’t messy at all. I just squirt some out onto my brush or sponge, dab it in areas on my face, then blend it out.<br /><br />They don’t have a large range of shade options - there’s only 2. With BB & CC creams, they’re usually so thin that a shade that’s a little off from you is usually still okay. I got the shade “#1 Light Beige.” I’m pretty pale. I can make the shade work for me, but I do wish it was a tad lighter. See my photos. I did a photo showing a drop of this Bb Cream, then a swatch doing 1 swipe with a small amount on my finger, then took what was left on my finger from the swatch and dabbed it and blended it out. I also show a photo of a swatch of this BB Blemish Cream, where I also show some blended out. Then I compared it to a swatch of L’Oréal Infallible Pro Glow in 201 Classic Ivory and Maybelline 24 Hr Foundation in 102 Fair Porcelain (I tried to use foundations most people might have tried). As you can see, both are lighter than this BB Blemish Cream. The Maybelline is MUCH lighter. I’m pretty pale, but even that one is a tad too pale for me, so I always have to warm it up with bronzer. But, this BB Blemish Cream is definitely on the darker side for me, but I’m able to make it work.<br /><br />The formula feels nice. It isn’t too thin or runny. It feels nice and creamy. On the product info page it said, “BB Cream Tinted Moisturizer Blemish Balm lets you perfectly blend & build tones from sheer to medium coverage.” Most BB creams I’ve tried are usually sheer to light, not able to go up to medium coverage. But, this actually provides a lot more coverage than I expected with a BB cream! I usually don’t go for BB/CC creams that often because they’re such light coverage. But, there’s times when I want lighter coverage and was looking for a new BB/CC cream and figured I’d give this a try. I’m really glad I did! It evens out my skin tone like I’d expect with a BB cream, but also provides decent coverage too. It doesn’t feel dry on my skin. You can also build it up too if you want, and it doesn’t look dry or cakey. I’d say you can get anywhere from really light coverage (like just evening out your skin tone and maybe covering small, light spots with a thin layer) to good medium coverage (if you build it up some). It builds up nicely enough where it might even be considered full coverage to some, but for me I consider it medium coverage 😂 I can’t build it up too much on myself because the color isn’t a good enough match for me. The more I build it up, the more it doesn’t match my skin. So, when I use this since it’s not really light enough for me, I can only use a thin layer of it. But, I did build it up just to test it out for this review and it looks nice and smooth on the skin whether you’re doing a light layer or building it up.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really great BB cream! It gives you more coverage than other BB creams I’ve tried. I like the squeeze tube. The product feels and looks nice on the skin. I definitely recommend giving this a try if you’re looking for something that will give you light to medium coverage while looking nice, smooth, and not dry or cakey.",1

This one has a very interesting smell. At first I didn't detect the chocolate, so it's a bit subtle. The smell is a powdery sweetness with a hint of chocolate. I threw away the wipe in my office trash can and caught pleasant whiffs of it throughout the day. Since the box comes with so many, I plan to put some in my daughter's Christmas stocking so she can try them out. They would also be great for traveling.",1

Fancy flower aside, this mask has absolutely no scent.  One of the main reasons I ordered this was because I expected a pleasant scent, so this was disappointing.  The mud is very thin and a little watery which was surprising.  Ultimately the mud doesn’t fully dry or pull my skin, and it’s pretty easy to wash off...no dried mud on my hairline!  There are little bits of something in the mud, leaves I think, that I don’t care for.  They’re aren’t a lot of them, so it seems like this wasn’t intentional and may be a quality control issue.  Up close the bits look a little rotten and rather unappealing.  After 15 minutes my pores look a little tighter, the few tiny blackheads I have are still there, and I can’t really say my skin feels more hydrated.  It doesn’t feel dry, it pretty much feels like it always does.  The packaging, as with all Freshme products is lovely, with the tube of mud packaged inside a matching box, so very giftable.  Personally, I prefer the Freshme sheet masks to this mud.  The clarifying benefits I expect from a mud mask just aren’t as obvious as I’d hoped.",0

This supposedly has peach notes in it, but I don't detect them. Fragrance is a very personal thing and it can smell differently depending on your body chemistry. I do like the concept of the petals.

The products are deluxe sample sizes, which is a perfect way to try out the line and find your favorite. 🌹<br /><br />I will start off with the Priming Water and Priming Essence. Both of these products come in dropper style ampoules. Neither of mine were filled to the top. These bottles are already on the smaller side, so it was especially disappointing to see missing product. For that, I've docked a star. [see photos attached, including one with a nail polish bottle for scale of sizing.]<br /><br />Both the Essence and Water feels like a light oil in texture. They spread easily, absorb quickly, and are meant to be used as the last step in your skin care. The No Poreblem primer in a tube is your silicone based makeup primer. It has that familiar silky finish, and does do a good job of blurring the pores. This is not so much a pore ""filling"" primer; this one works more to smooth them out, and creates a nice base for your foundation.<br /><br />All of the products in this set have a light rose scent, which smells divine. I am not usually fond of most rosy florals because they are always either too strong, smell artificial, or very old lady-ish. This scent is none of those things. Touch in Sol has nailed the rose fragrance - it's lightweight, very fresh, and I really enjoy it. As someone who is skin sensitive to added fragrance, I had zero reactions to any of these products. 🌹",1

Unfortunately, some of the strings were loose, so not a very high quality sewing.  Because the product is made with soft microfiber material, it does not work as well as a regular towel to dry the hair. The cap is even less effective than the turban, because the hair stays loose inside and the moisture does not absorb. My daughter complained that she wore the wrap for a while and when she took it off, her hair was still very wet. She told me that the regular towels work much better. The material also takes forever to dry once it gets wet, unlike a regular towel. Therefore, I wish that the product was made of an actual towel material.

The tubes of product have gold caps and clear tubes, so you can see the shade. The brand name and logo is on the front of the tubes in gold.

The shimmer with them looks even with application. You can layer them well. They don’t take too long to dry. They lasted well on my hooded eyes without creasing (that is, no more than what I normally get with any eyeshadow). When the light hits these they look so beautiful.<br /><br />I show photos of swatches - I did 1 swipe for each color. Then I did little areas where I layered the colors to show how they built up.

This is my first time trying this brand, and I am very impressed.<br /><br />The instant-foaming face wash:<br />I have never tried an instant-foaming wash before. It still produced a nice lather on my face. It is great for a daily moisturizer, but I still like to use an exfoliant every few days.<br /><br />The serum:<br />The serum had a more creamy texture. It soaked into my skin quick. It created a nice based for the moisturizer.<br /><br />The moisturizer:<br />The moisturizer was thick and creamy. I have VERY dry skin, and my skin soaked it right up. It felt really nice on my skin. My skin stayed moisturized throughout the day after using in the morning.<br /><br />None of the products irritated my skin. I have dry skin with some rosacea. All products had a similar light floral scent. The sizes are great. I still have plenty of product after using a few weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this set!

The magnets aren't super strong, but they don't seem any weaker then other brands that offer a cats eye effect nail product.<br /><br />Set times are the same as any other gel polish under the UV/LED light.  I do find that even after letting this polish cure for 90 sec, if I don't apply a top coat then it always had a slightly tacky feel.

I love that the color was long lastig and definitely shimmery.  It didn't flake off as some glitter based ones do.  I found the best effect occurred if I let a layer dry and then added more - to build up the shine but if I didn't wait long enough between layers it did get a little clumpy.

My boyfriend complained that the scent was overwhelming and smelled like “old lady” perfumes and asked me not to wear it.<br /><br />I also found the packaging to be wasteful, you can’t recycle any of it except for the box so if you do end up liking this sort of scent I would just buy the bottle instead.",0

The caps are on the small side - good for a child and an average adult-sized head but not good if you have a large head.  The price is low but then you get what you are paying for - the quality is average - better than a 99 cent discount store but made of a cheap synthetic fiber that doesn't feel that durable or long term.

The size is perfect to try something new without buying them individually and obviously, they're great for travel. The entire set is meant to be used together before makeup application for a good base. I like them all but particularly enjoyed the prime essence and priming water. They both feel very light, sometimes I use them without the primer. As for the primer in particular, it's heavy on dimethicone which is something I usually try to avoid in my primers. While it leaves a silky feeling, I just am not a fan. I think it's just a cheap filler that a lot of products rely heavily on. I feel like my skin can't breathe when there's silicone primers on it. But that is just personal preference. I will use it on occasion when doing a full face. Overall I think this is a nice set so I'm happy I tried it.",1

I have used it for a little while now, and am liking the hydration, and hopefully with more time, perhaps a little regenerative effect on my skin to give me a nicer more youthful glow.  Retinol seems to be all of the rage lately, and to be honest I wasn't even really aware that this had retinol in it until I read the ingredients a little closer.  I started by simply applying it to my desired area via the dropper that it uses for applying the product, but I soon learned that my preferable method of using it is to mix a drop or two with my facial moisturizing cream, and spread it around that way.  I have used facial serums before, and they tended to be a little more oily and thicker.  It's for that reason that I think I prefer mixing it with my cream, because when I tried to simply apply it straight to my face, it kind of ran down my face and didn't really stay put to where I wanted it to.  that being said, I do like the effect it has given me.  My primary reason for use is hydration, which honestly I don't always achieve with my facial cream alone.  I still tend to have a dry spot or two to contend with with just a cream or moisturizer.  This mixed with the cream does not leave me with any dry spots, and I hope that with more use, I will perhaps turn back the clock a little on wrinkles and sun damaged areas, as I live in south Florida, and sun damage is easy to come by.  I really like it so far, and have high hope for continued use.  I do recommend it.",1

I could pretty much duplicate this scrub from stuff in my kitchen for a lot less money. It's coffee grounds, olive oil, salt and sugar, basically. There are a few other little active oils which I happen to also have around as I make my own soap, so the vitamin E oil, ect, is already in my cupboard as well.<br /><br />The big question though... is it WORTH duplicating (or purchasing again)?<br />The answer for me is, unfortunately, no. It doesn't do much for my skin besides leave it feeling exfoliated, which any scrub can do. As other reviewers have said, the packaging is not shower friendly and it's a loose scrub. So I had to mix this with some coconut oil and clean out an old empty jar to store it in the shower. It's a lot of effort for a mediocre product.<br /><br />It does what it says but there are better options out there.",0

I've been concern lately of these items with ingredients that are bad for us and we don't even know! So I dont actually use this alone. I use a makeup remover wipe first and then I use this also to catch what is left. What i noticed is that this isn't the type of remover where you just used it and then can walk away. You do have to use water to clean off your face after. I also have sensitive skin and I will say it did not irritate my skin at all. I didn't think it had any smell to it really.

Really concentrated and thick/creamy, and you can definitely feel the sunscreen in it, cuz it makes it more thicker than most other BB creams with low levels of SPF. The color selection is SUPER limited, but I chose the lightest one and I am normally like a 120 Ivory in Maybelline (Matte version) drugstore foundation. It blended out very well. You need only but a small amount of it so it lasts a long time, and it has a pleasant smell to it (at least for me). The only and only thing I dislike is the cakiness of this foundation that forms in creases (around the mouth, eyes, forehead, chin area etc.). Primer no primer, lotion or no/lotion, setting spray or no setting spray - or just on bare cleansed face. Cakiness still forms for me in about 30-60 minutes. This happens even with super little application - which is annoying. But the quality of coverage and texture is there if it wasn't for the cakiness I experience every time I use it.",1

Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive because I really didn't notice much of a  difference after using this mud mask.  Its on the light, watery side so its easy to apply and doesn't take much to cover my face.  In the 15 minutes it sits on my skin (10-15 recommended per directions) it never entirely dries and I don't experience the feeling of skin tightening at all.  After I rinse it off (it rinses without issue), my skin feels clean but a bit dry. I cannot detect any change to my pores.  This just isn't the mud mask for me.

I just started wearing these lashes but I like them. They're a bit more voluminous and dense than anything I currently offer, but they hold up very well. My only complaint with how these were packaged is that unlike when you buy singles, it's not obvious which is for the right vs the left eye. So, if you're the type who needs to customize the length — and the length of both eyes is slightly different — it's easy to get the right vs. left mixed up.<br /><br />But so far, I'm a fan. I've worn them twice and there's been no shedding. So, I'll do a bit more testing to see how this first pair holds up, but I might have found my new vendor for cruelty-free synthetic lashes!",1

I like that they are made in USA, handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small, but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically, it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.<br /><br />The bars are thin, but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now, and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.<br /><br />The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove, Cinnamon, Oregano, Peppermint, Parsley, Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.<br /><br />It has been an odd, but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.<br /><br />""CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients.

This was the first time I have owed and used a UV lamp by myself to cure my nails. I def like the initial unpackaging the machine itself looks professional and well made. It plugs into the wall the cord could be a tad longer but it was workable. I didnt read over the instructions since I have seen this machine be used both in the nail salon on a number of ocassions not regularly but I am a quick study. I have also seen ppl I watch on youtube use machines like this as well so I was familar with the concept of what your suppose to do. Now I did pair this with gel polish that I had never used before so my review may not be the best since I am unfamilar with both the product and the products used but it is coming from a first time user as I am sure there are others out there like myself. So in use I will say the machine does get warm not hot but warm depending on how long your using it. The light is very bright and def caught me off guard. The buttons are extremely easy to use but I love that the machine also has a sensor so you dont have to push the button if you dont need to which I thought was a nice touch. The only downside of that is if you lift your palm up then it goes off so its extremely important to pay attention to the numbers you were on for curing sake. I will say thou using this machine at first with the base coat that I was using it came out tacky so my first thought is great I was excited about using this and it doesnt all the way work but once I thought to just go ahead and apply the first layer of polish, cure, and then do the top coat everything was fine. So overall this works great and I look forward to using again in the future as I begin experimenting with both gel polish and poly gel (I think its called). As stated I am a quick study and I dont think I did too bad of a job my first time around.",1

This is a very nice retinol oil that has quickly become one of my favorites. It comes in a little dropper bottle. It has a very mild and very pleasant fragrance that I really like a lot. It lingers for a bit and I wish it would linger a lot longer than it does to be honest. I can’t figure out what it smells like but I really like the mix of it. This contains retinyl palmitate, related to retinol. Remember, whenever you use retinol you want to make sure to protect your skin from the sun since retinol makes your skin more sensitive to the sun. However retinol is very good for your skin.<br /><br />This face oil is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. It does leave your skin slightly oily but to me that is ok since I am using a face oil. I prefer to use this at night for two reasons, one because my face is a bit oily for a while when using it and also because retinol containing products do make your skin more sensitive to the sun. When I use this product my skin feels always super soft and smooth and looks nicely moisturized. There are little specs in it that look like gold and I am not sure if it is that or something else but when I use this facial oil my skin has this natural glow to it that I really like. This oil is fantastic and is quickly becoming one of my go to facial oils.",1

It's stated on the box that they try to be zero waste, but honestly... not really. They come individually packaged in a plastic bag and in a box, which are both not biodegradable.

Before getting it I was thinking it was going to be like regular soap but when you see it it’s anything but regular soap.  My roommate and I were both a bit confused thinking perhaps these were bath bombs because the look is similar to bath bombs more than it is to bar soap. I had to revisit the listing to double-check that it is meant to be used as soap.<br /><br />Usage is interesting.  It does break down very quickly though it stays intact long enough to use as bar soap.  You just don’t get many washes out of each bar.  With water, it does suds up a good amount which I like.  It also gets a bit milky looking and the gritty texture does exfoliate too.<br /><br />After using it I like the feeling of it on my skin.  My skin feels a little tingly, refreshed, and soft.  So it does work well for me as a soap but it just doesn’t last long.<br /><br />The scent is not my favorite at all.  Some might enjoy the scent but it’s very strongly clove-scented.  It’s a bit too overbearing for my tastes. The scent also seems to last on my skin for a little longer than normal bar soap would.  If I was more fond of the scent this would be a good thing.<br /><br />Overall it’s a decent product but it’s not really for me.  I just don’t love the scent and it’s a bit too different from normal bar soap for me.  I love the exfoliating ability of this soap.  That is the one area I really liked and I would buy this if I found a scent I enjoyed.  The price is reasonable given that you get 6 bars.  I would say they last maybe 1/3rd to 1/4th of the length of most bar soaps and that might be a stretch.",1

The word ""bubble"" is normally used for cleansing wipes. I received the product, tried it, then realized that it's basically an upgrade version of cotton pads. It's definitely not ""one-step"" if you need to use water of makeup remover with this pad.<br />Also it's quite expensive - $15 for 15 pieces. To me it cleans as good as regular cotton pads. There's nothing special about it other than the design where you can stick fingers into and hold it while wiping your face. Overall ok product. Definitely overpriced and need more instructions on the jar. Took me a while to figure out how to use it.",0
AEQ7D7IDDUFNPOL4VDSXWZPIWKUQ,B08J7R5HHX,4,2020-12-01 21:53:38.734,Eyelash Serum,"I've used an eyelash serum before and had some success with it in the past. Hoping for positive results from BEPHOLAN serum. Ingredients are reported to be natural ingredients such as hydrolyzed oat protein, olive glycerides, and sodium hyaluronate. After doing a bit of online investigation about sodium hyaluronate, there is some indication that it can assist in hair growth. It may moisturize the hair shaft and keep it from breakage. Turns out, it could help hair growth. So, does this apply to eyelashes? Hmm. The serum comes in a mascara tube. Instead of applying with a brush, the serum is applied to the eye with a mascara wand. I've gotta say - I thought this would be better applied to roots, but the serum doesn't seem to adhere to the wand as it would to a small brush-on wand. I have to really dig the wand into the container to get the serum to stick to the applicator. My solution is to use my own small paintbrush. Thankfully, it seems to apply to my lashes much better. I've been using this lash serum for less than a week. I don't normally post reviews until I've had noticeable improvements. The product description says that lashes may show improvement within two weeks. I will post an update in two weeks to a month. I believe consistency is key with most of these products. I use it twice a day on days that I'm on top of my game. It's quick and easy. Most days, though, it's once a day. BEPHOLAN Cosmetics suggests taking a BEFORE and AFTER picture of your lashes. Stay tuned.",1

I choose the option for the ""mascara brush"" style, as I thought this might be easier to use than the thin brush styles I've tried in the past.  My results with this were mixed.  First, the product is barely discernible on the brush!  It seems only completely dry; more product gets on the wand part than on the brush end.  Second, the brush is plastic and feels VERY harsh; a brush with soft bristles might have been better.<br /><br />That being said, this product has seemed to help my lashes somewhat.  The effect isn't very noticeable with bare lashes, but when I use mascara, my lashes do look thicker and longer than they would normally.  I have used this product on my eyebrows too and have seen some improvement there as well.  I wish this was a little easier to use; I would rate it about three and a half stars.",1

They're not high end designer, but they aren't dollar store quality either. A few of mine came with some scratches on the pearls, but since I received this as a sample, I did not reduce my rating. I did, however, deduct a star because on the larger barette clips the pearls are not thoroughly attached. {see photo} On the skinny hair pins, the pearls are wrapped all the way down the length of the hair pin. The larger barettes are only attached on the ends. With that, I have some reservations on how long these will actually last. I suppose with careful handling, and maybe occasional use they should be okay. All in all, they are pretty and I think they are worth the price.",1

I do have some experience with coconut oil but this is my first time using sweet almond oil.  Thanks the labels on the bottles, reviews and internet searches, I'm finding SO many ways to use these oils...sometimes together, sometimes individually.<br /><br />Because I have terribly dry, sensitive skin, my main goal was to see how one or both oils could help protect my skin, especially now that winter has arrived and my skin is REALLY taking a beating.  Both oils work well to hydrate and moisturize, so I mixed a few ounces of each in a mist bottle. After I bathe, I mist  a combo of the oils over my skin to help hydrate and moisturize. The oils absorb quickly and do not leave an oily/greasy look OR feel to my skin.  I'm already seeing a decrease in my dry skin/itchy red patches of skin. I experience NO discomfort whatsoever when misting these oils onto my sensitive skin.  Both oils also work wonders on hair by moisturizing, hydrating, improving hair texture/strength, stimulate hair growth /thicken hair, and nourish the scalp to prevent dry, itchy flakes. In addition to using my combo of oils after bathing, I also give my hair a spray or two with the mister and sure enough, I'm seeing less hair in the drain and on my hairbrush after brushing. My hair is soft, smooth and shiny WITHOUT looking or feeling oily/greasy from the oil combo.<br /><br />I use the coconut oil (alone) to help remove makeup, under and around my eyes to soften and reduce fine lines, I rub a small amount into my scalp (as does my husband) to help stimulate hair growth, on the kid's faces after their baths to soften (especially in cold weather!), on my nail beds every couple of days and a light amount on any patches of eczema/red skin.  (It relieves the itching/burning and redness from eczema quickly!)<br /><br />I use the sweet almond oil (alone) on  dark circles under my eyes, a SMALL amount on split ends in my hair, a drop on chapped lips, I'm just starting to tinker with it for aromatherapy purposes.  I recently learned that it can help fade scars so I've begun to rub some sweet almond oil into a scar on my finger to see what happens. If it helps, I'll then move on to a small facial scar I have. I'm also trying something on my own; just started doing this a few days ago.  I get nosebleeds every single day, at least once a day, throughout the winter when the heat is on in the house. This started when I was 2 years old, I'm now 49 so I've experienced this my entire life.  I now rub a small amount of sweet almond oil under my nostrils before bed.  Since starting this, I continue to have nosebleeds. Yesterday, I had only one and it involved just a few drops of blood. I didn't whip through numerous tissues like normal.  ONE tissue took care of it. (that's huge for me!) I have NO clue if its just a coincidence or if the sweet almond oil is helping in any way but I'm going to continue using it.<br /><br />These oils are phenomenal! Both bottles are 16oz.  I love the fact that they have normal caps on them but pumps for each bottle are included as well.  The liquid of each is thinner oil than I expected, which I prefer.  Both absorb quickly. Neither has a scent.  I've found SO many uses for these oils, I can't wait to discover more. ( I'm SO happy with these oils, I recently purchased Shiny Leaf's biotin hair conditioner and cannot wait to try it! ) I find the price to be incredibly reasonable, especially since you're getting TWO bottles of oils! HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />*FYI...the mist bottle on the end in my photo is NOT included! I used one of my  own mist bottles to combine both oils.  You will get both bottles AND pumps that you see in my photo, NOT the mist sprayer!",1

Usually, when you put foundation over your nose or area where you have large pores, you can see them.<br /><br />With this, the pores are much smaller. The tube is a PUTTY to put over your pores area and it works well to smooth pits or areas that you have dented skin. The two serums are priming serums to even put the skins texture and help the makeup stick to your face. Dan onto the skin—don’t rub.<br /><br />Great for everyday wear.

Not a negative just a FYI.  Nice even coating and I would recommend 2 normal coats for the best look.<br /><br />The set or cure times are no different then any other gel polish I have worked with.

While the scent isn't overwhelmingly strong, you can definitely smell it when you are using the soap or if the soap is not in a container even when you are in the same room. We have a couple of bars sitting next to our bathroom sink, and you can smell them when you walk into the bathroom. To me, the most obvious scent is the clove. The other scents are cinnamon, oregano, rosemary, peppermint, parsley, and eucalyptus.<br /><br />I've liked the soap so far. It lathers up well. It's kind of a weird experience to wash with this. It's not really a scent that I generally associate with cleaning myself. While these scents might remind you more of your favorite Italian dish than what you would normally use as soap, if these are all smells that you generally enjoy, it's worth trying this soap.",1

You can adjust the mist from light to heavy as well as the jet spray is adjustable.  The bottom portion (where water is held) of the bottle material is thicker than most spray bottles you'll find in big brick and mortar which somewhat justifies the higher cost. However, I found that they should have made the top (spray portion) of the bottle thicker with a better mechanism. I've owned several of these types of bottles that I get for $1 in big brick and mortar and know too well that over time the trigger will malfunction so I was expecting a higher quality here but that was not the case. Therefore, unless you simple want a bigger bottle to hold more water over the conventional spray bottles found in the local well-known brick and mortar stores then this may work for you but just know it's the same bottle just bigger with a slightly better material. Just don't expect a better quality trigger than the ones you would've found in your local W or T stores.",0

I finish it off with a blow dryer with a diffuser but this gets out all the excess moisture and being able to put it up really keeps it out of my way. It came with a couple of scrunchies as well.

So when my oldest seen these and I used them in her hair she was like ok I want one now too and then I also thought these would be great for my son who also has tons of hair and curly hair at that. So now everyone has one and I think I may sadly be getting another set for my daughters when there at their dads house too. They love these brushes and I have to attest using these to comb thru their hair makes things a world easier and less of a hassle I do wish they had a grip on the handle for wet hands but really outside of that I dont have any complaints. These come in packs of 2 and even if you dont have kids using one in a purse and keeping one home is enough reasons to get these especially if you have thick hair these are amazing. My kids are mixed and range from hair length to neck length to butt length and I will tell you these are amazing at handling getting thru those thick tangles. The back has a piece that allows you to have the comb itself at different firmness I like the top one personally it is the firmest level.

Years ago, she asked me if I wanted to perm my lashes when she came down to visit. I thought she was crazy! This was like 10 years ago. I never heard of such a thing and I didn't do it. Well I don't know what happened recently for this to suddenly now become popular. One of my friends and I were talking about lash extensions and lattisse. I was telling her how my eye lids turn red when i try to use lattisse. I even tried the RF brand and same thing! Anyhows, then i've been doing exentions for about a year now but I am finding that my lash is getting worst and worst.. like when my extensions fall out, I barely have lashes! I used to have average lash that  I could curl. But now it seems like I barely have anything. So this is why I decided to finally consider perming my lash. So perming the did not make it longer by any means! What it did though is made it look like I had lashes that were longer but it curved up! My lash tends to grow straight. It may have have to do with the fact that I have asian eyes. So the curling has always been important when I used to wear mascara. The thing is I hate that sometimes it poked at me and the curler would yank some lashes out!  Also I just hate it doing it every day. With perm lashes, you don't have to do this. However, I don't know if I could have done this alone. I had to get a friend to help me. She said it was pretty easy. What took the longest is us reading things over and over to make sure we weren't going to make me blind! I think it took about an hour or so? I can't recall exactly as we didn't time it.  The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that you really cannot do this by yourself.  Now it may not look drastic to most people bc they don't usually notice your lashes. But you would b/c you know how they look before. Then add mascara and you can definitely tell.",1

I'm mean it's reeeealy soft, and not oily or greasy at all. It's AMAZING. What really has me addicted is the smell. It's not floral or citrus, or really like anything I can put my finger on. If I had to, I'd say it's faintly sweet… possibly herbal? Well, whatever it is, it's intoxicating to me. It lingers just a while after the serum dries and I thoroughly enjoy it.

And after a few uses trying it as a body wash and not really liking it, I really only use it on my face now. I don’t think I would reorder this.",0

May not be the prettiest, but its about being creative. The mat is the perfect size and the paints are easy to clean up. They are washable so the hands can be cleaned up after. It comes with the paints and brushes, so no need to buy some. It also folds into a storage box, which is excellent for keeping the mess contained. You want to fold the velcro in, not out.

I actually got them to review them while I review wigs. Now some of the reviewers complaints were that the wig grips are tight and it is sort of true for me. But most my wigs are glueless ( and they usually are already tight) but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't wear them most of the day. I have an average size head. If you have a very sensitive head, I recommend you wear a wig cap because they can pull a haor are two. I do wear wig caps and the grip hold on the wig and the wig does sit still. Unless the wig is bigger than your head and then the wig might move around. But sometimes I don't wear a wig cap and it is comfortable for me. Now to get to the nitty gritty, these wig grip work better than any velvet wig grip I have every used. It has kept my non lace front and my lace fronts still on my head. They come in a clear a a clear tan color. I love using them alot! Especially with the lace fronts because you cannot see them through the lace and they do not leave ""bumps"" on the wig. I can pull them to the edge of my head and it is snug but not headache snug to me. Now I dont believe they are for people with big heads but I do suggest trying because you never know.",1

With the magnetic affect, they're very different, but still stunning. I actually feel that even with the magnetic affect, one coat was just fine.

Upon first opening this flosser, it's very unique and different and would be great for traveling. The way the pieces of it fit together so compactly into each other, and then into a very nice fabric zip case with a handle, definitely sets this flosser apart.<br />When I used it, I found that it did not have near the amount of pressure that I'm used to from my other flosser. As nice as it is, it didn't feel as if it was cleaning between my teeth very well. I felt it gave a nice surface clean, but the pressure of the water was not enough to force out any particles from in between my teeth.<br />The flosser is also extremely loud. I've had the one I'm using for quite a while, and though it makes some noise, it isn't loud enough to hear from a couple of rooms away with the door shut. This one was scary loud. I'm not sure if it may have a defect or not, so others may not have this problem.<br />For me, this flosser does not have enough power behind it, and it is just too loud for my liking.

It comes with two viles of the eyeliner, application teasers and 10 pairs of lashes. I love the style of lashes because they're more natural and I can pull them off verses some others that have really thick dramatic ones that are so full, that they make me look ridiculous, these pairs have really thick bands though,  which isn't my favorite but again I shouldn't complain given the price.

The spongy foam has a grittiness, so it conforms to the nail with the intent to smooth out ridges or any 'imperfections'. The emery planks have 2 different levels of grit: 100 & 180. The 100 grit is suitable for artificial nails, the 180 intended for natural nails. The cleaning brush is decent and does an adequate job. The cuticle cutting tool is rather generic, but is functional, as well.<br />At under $6, this is probably priced accurately. 6 dual function emery boards, 6 gritty foam sponges, brush and cuticle cutter for the price seems acceptable.

The packaging and presentation gave the immediate feel of an expensive and regal product. The actual tube and brush of the serum also are impeccable with regard to presentation. The serum itself is very basic and lacking a little in desired thickness. Using a simple thin brush like the one that is provided makes for a bit of a challenge in applying such a watery textured liquid to your brow. A spoolie type brush would have made application on your brows much easier. Having said that, the brush that is provided is perfect for application of the serum to your eyelashes which, like brows, respond to the same formulas to encourage retention of existing lashes and brows and promote growth of new ones. I have been using this product nightly for nearly two months now and definitely see a bit of noticeable growth in my lashes and some growth, though not as noticeable, in my brows. Part of that could be due to the slow rate of growth of eyebrows and part could be due to the uneven application on my eyebrows with the small liner like application brush.

It has a wide mouth so you can put both hands in if your hands are small and the same goes with your feet.<br />The LED screen is bright and easy to read. It has a strong UV light but you can adjust the speed so you can use just enough to dry your nails (too much may be bad for your hands).

Included in this set are 6 bottles of quality gel polish, 7.5ml (0.25 ounces). While each bottle could do a few maniures, I think of them as being more akin to samplers. For the price, I would have like more quantity.<br />It's winter, in fact we're having a severe snow storm right now. So, perhaps the cold affected the polish. Per the companies suggestion, we immersed a bottle in warm/hot water (not too hot). This had the effect of loosening the consistency of the gel polish. Whew!<br />The polish, with metallic glitter, is like metallic paint on a car, only more shiny and glittery. My original intent was to use this on 3D printed models, or for my crafts. But, the significant other made a convincing argument that it's gel NAIL polish. So, she claimed it (after I restored it via the hot water bath), and took it to her nail art/crafts station. She mentioned that it didn't have the strong 'stink' that some other glitter gel polishes have. Okay...She said that if she does her nails, she can't help me shovel the snow tomorrow. Why didn't I think of doing my nails, first?<br />The price of this set is slightly higher than comparable products (a dollar or two). I can't compare the products, but the quality of this set is very good. Plus, the fact that it needed a hot water bath, I feel the thickness is a positive indication of the quality of the polish. Being thicker means needing less for good coverage.<br />Overall, positive impresseions regarding this gel polish. It garners a solid 4 star rating, with a moderately high level recommendation.",1

I cannot speak to the power of the ingredients here, because generally these things take time to show results. But I did like the creamy feel and the way this felt on my skin. I've been curious about trying pro-biotics for some time, and the other ingredients intrigued me, but only time will tell if this changes anything at all. If you are buying this, you are more or less in the same boat. What I DEFINITELY appreciate is that this is scent free. So many products feel the need to load up on supposedly ""mild"" fragrance. Well, NEWS FLASH! A ""mild"" scent can quickly become overwhelming when mixed with other products as you do in the Korean method. Secondly, people who are sensitive to scents (triggers migraines) are more common than you might think. Having a perfume in a face product serves no purpose at all, and I am grateful that this company understands.<br /><br />The label on the bottle is completely in Korean, which means you can't tell what is inside. I had to come here to see. That is a small thing, and did not effect my opinion of the product.",1

This product is water based and does not dry on my skin like most clay masks do. After I apply this to my face and leave it on for about 15 minutes, it still feels moist and slick when I go to rinse it off. The texture of this mask is more gel-like than it is clay. It feels lightweight and does not leave my skin feeling too dry and tight. This mask is effective enough for use during the winter, when my skin tends to be more dry. The product packaging looks attractive, but I wonder if they intentionally misspelled the word “moisturizing” as “moistorizing”.",0

Once you understand the twirling left and right (depending in which direction you want your curls), you'll be on your way to curls that look right out of a beauty pageant. I don't say that in a negative way. They are very beautifully curled. Little girls would love having these curls.<br /><br />You can curl them and then brush them out a bit to give them a more natural look. The two barrels are easily interchangeable so you can do large curls and small curls. I have very thick hair and found these to be fun to wear without needing that hair cut.

I find that using a half-gallon of water with about 3/4 tablespoon of product (half the water and product recommended) works fine for me, as I'm just soaking one foot in a small tub.  The scent is citrus; I am scent-sensitive, and it is a bit strong to me.  I think it would be great for someone dealing with foot odor.<br /><br />It's really important to thoroughly dry the foot afterward;  I dab it with a towel and then run a small fan next to my foot till it's completely dry.

It takes a bit longer than I was hoping to fully dry, but after about 10 minutes, you’re good to go. I like this because it’s small and light so I can pack it with me anywhere. It is easy to use, and a child could use it (with supervision so they don’t look into the light) because you just slide your hand under the light and it will detect your hand and start the light/ drying process. I have noticed that the lag time seems to be getting longer on the motion detecting light, but it’s not extremely bothersome. Sometimes it takes a few swipes, but it generally works. It’s a great thing to have if you enjoy doing your nails at home, or even just a fun “spa” thing to do with your friends, or kids during winter and/ or quarantine. This is by no means a professional style nail lamp but for the price, it gets the job done.",1

I spray a few pumps on my hair and smooth it in with a comb, and then let my hair air dry overnight and I’ve noticed a significant difference in frizz control. My hair kinda feels/ looks poofy and frizzy after I wash it and this product tames my hair without weighing it down at all. My hair just feels softer and smoother when I use it, but I don’t feel it in my hair at all, it quickly absorbs. I have long hair and this size is more of a travel size bottle for me, even using just a few pumps every few nights, I’m down to the last bit of product. I will likely order it again because it’s seamless for frizz, and I like how weightless it is.",1

Dr. Denese has a fantastic product line, and I love her magnetic face mask, amongst other things. I didn’t get this product for the anti-aging properties, but more for the moisture and exfoliating base. I use it after I cleanse and tone my face, let it fully absorb for a few minutes, and then apply my serums and/or just moisturizer. When I use it at night I find that my skin feels plumper and moisturized when I wake up. The 2oz bottle can stretch out over a long period of time too, so the product is worth the money, it’s just not quite in my everyday price range. I do like that I can cut out serums at night and still feel like I’m treating my face. I don’t have visible wrinkles yet so I haven’t seen any anti-wrinkle effects, but my skin does feel fuller, if that makes sense. My skin feels tighter in a good way, and my skin looks and feels softer and just overall more even looking.",1

I use it as my first step in dissolving the grime and skin care products I used during the day (mostly SPF,  I dont wear makeup but rarely). I have dry skin, semi sensitive and this is soothing feeling as well as non irritating. The combo of Centella Asiatica (soothing, skin health) and Hyaluronic Acid (retaining moisture) are the clear winning ingredients in this awesome oil cleanser.<br /><br /> I dab this oil cleanser all over the face, then let the heat of my hands melt it into my skin. It quickly turns to a spreadable oil to massage in all over. I really like the solid balm to oils over the liquid oils as I find them easier to work with. They also seem to rinse away cleaner? I feel like I could use this Mizon oil balm as my only cleansing step, but I am rather used to doing a 2nd cleanse with a gentle cleanser to wash off any remaining dissolved gunk from the first wash. You'll have to try it out for yourself.<br /><br />Currently using this gentle, clean, vegan cleanser by To Do List as my second cleanse after Mizon:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDJR7S4<br /><br />I have a couple of double duty balm-to- oil cleansers that I like, and I would consider Mizon Cicaluronic  as a repurchase.",1

I usually have an over flow of makeup and brushes even though I try to purge from time to time the items that I do not use. This makes it so much easier to see what make up I am currently using. Love the little compartments and the attached mirror! I might also end up using this for jewelry as well since I think I don't like the clutter of jewelry I have going on right now. I like that this is also somewhat portable because I can move this room to room without spillage. Overall, a really great way to organize your jewelry or makeup items!",1

I ordered this set because I loved the holiday designs and remembered how much fun these were. I like that this came with a clear silicon stamper. It is so much easier to see that you've picked up the design and where you are trying to place it. This also came with a thick sturdy scraper, about the size of a debit card. It actually scrapes quite nicely and doesn't scratch up the plate like other scrapers I have used in the past. With regular polish, this works very well but you have to work quick. With gel polish, you have to let the polish set into the design for about 20 seconds, scrap, let set another 20 seconds, then pick up the design. You also have to really know exactly where you want to place your design and instead of rocking back and forth, you firmly place down the stamp for the best, most crisp stamp. If not, with gel, it tends to be less crisp or smear. It's definitely a learning curve if you are working with gel. Still, this set works really well and I can do more designs rather than trying to hand paint details on. Love this nail stamping set!",1

The smaller roller feels perfect on my eye areas. I love how it relaxes me. I like to put mine on the fridge for awhile so it feels colder on my skin and after I use it it feels good.<br /><br />NO CONS YET! I know this kind of stuff takes awhile before you can really see a difference on your skin. If you have never use anything like this give it at least 3 months to see a difference (6 months to really see how much your skin have improved).

All of these except for the silver are holo, so it's so hard to pick just one favorite, especially when the silver is a metallic foil!<br />All of the polishes are pictured in two coats just to show how that looks, but if you're going for full opacity you might want to do a third especially if you have long nails. Alternatively, you could wear them over a similar base color. They cured just fine under my lamp in 60 seconds; they are wipe colors though, so you either need to wipe them or put a top coat on. They're pictured without a top coat, because this kit didn't come with one. They're still wonderfully shiny without a top coat!<br />The bottles of this set come with numbered dots to label them, but not colored dots; however, it comes with a sheet of stickers that you can swatch them on your own. If you're like me and have other gels which also don't have colored dots, you might be happy to know this comes with a few extra stickers so you can do a couple of others too.

This is definitely something worth investing in. I got this so I can take it on the go to retouch my makeup or do it if I need to have it done last min.

They lather well and do leave skin softer than after use of regular soap. The only problem is that you use it once, and it starts to disintegrate. It turns into mush that can be scooped up from the soap dish. Even if you completely dry it, it still disintegrates. I like using it but I wish it would keep its shape.",1

There is an impressive list of ingredients and no problematic chemical additives. This nourishes the skin and doesn't have a strong fragrance.

For each bottle they supply you with a pump dispenser which is great. It makes it so much easier to dispense the oil without making a mess to be honest. Both oils are claimed to be organic which is nice. This will run you $25 which in my eyes is a good deal.<br /><br />These oils can be used direct for skin care and as carrier oils, meaning you can add some essential oils to them to make your own custom oil blends. The oils themselves were pretty much fragrance-free which was a bit disappointing to me, but makes sense since these are often used as carrier oils. When you use this they are pretty lightweight and absorb quickly. I found they do leave the skin a bit greasy, but that is not a surprise since these are oils. That feeling does go away within about 15 minutes or so, so not too bad. All in all a good deal",1

Really beautiful roller and I thought the derma roller was really cool...until I read the instructions. “Roll back and forth 4-5 times...only apply light pressure and do not PUNCTURE the skin....sterilize the roller before and after each use for 30 MINUTES in disinfecting alcohol”. Y’all, I’m a busy mom with a toddler, I do not have the time to disinfect something for almost an hour each time I use it, and by use it, I mean roll it 4-5 times total. So while the jade roller is really beautiful and easy to use in of itself, this derma roller kinda seems...extra. I personally would prefer this to just be the roller; I’m too worried about actually using the roller incorrectly and hurting my skin, so I’ll just leave that type of work to the professionals. If you are looking for a jade roller only, there are lots of other options. If you want the full derma experience, then this option would be great for you.",0

Not too Pigmented But Do Build Up Well!,"These come in an outer product box that is sealed in clear plastic wrapping. Once you remove the plastic wrapping, the product box has an open window in the front where you can see the eyeshadow shadow sticks (see photos). The back of the box lists the ingredients be the manufacturer (in China). It also has the cruelty free bunny logo. (See photos)<br /><br />The eyeshadow sticks are all in black tubes. They have the brand name “Luxaza” along with the name of the shade on the front written in the shade of the shadow stick. There’s black lids on one end and a clear lid on the other end. Under the clear lid, there’s a brush. Now...it was really weird with the brush end. First, I went to pull off the clear cap, and it wouldn’t pull off. So I thought maybe it was screw off, so when I tried to twist it, I heard the clicking sound like the crayon part was twisting out, which I didn’t want since I still had the cap on that end. I then pulled really hard and the clear cap came off. Then, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush to feel it, and it looked like a bunch of powder came flying off of it. So I thought maybe I missed somewhere where it said the other end of the shadow stick had a powder brush. So, I went to the product page to see and it doesn’t say anything about powder. It was just what I initially thought, that it’s a brush to blend out the shadow stick. So, I brushed my finger across the tip of the brush again to see if more powder came off and none did. So, I then took the clear cap off another shadow stick and brushed my finger across the tip of that brush to see if powder would come off...none did. Then I went through doing that with all the other shadow sticks and no powder type stuff came off of those. So I don’t know what it was with that first one...or if I’m just crazy which is entirely possible too 😂 Anyways, the brush feels nice and soft. It’s short and dense, but still a little fluffy, so blends out color well. Like I said, the clear cap is a little tough to remove...I really had to pull to get it off each shadow stick. Also, you need to be careful when putting the cap back on because the hairs of the brush get in the way.<br /><br />The crayon part you don’t need to sharpen. It twists up. You twist the end with the brush. There’s not too much product in the tube. I twisted them all the way up to see. It ends up looking to be less than half the size of the tube (see photos, I took a photo of one twisted all the way up). They do feel smooth and creamy. They aren’t very pigmented. To get the pigment you see in my swatches, I needed to go over them each quite a few times (about 5 times). Most are shimmers. 2 of them have glitter particles in them (“Mermaid Teardrop” and “Purple Sunset”). The glitter isn’t too bad, it doesn’t fall out and leave glitter particles everywhere. But, like any glitter, when you try to remove it, you will see glitter particles randomly afterwards (anyone who have used anything with any glitter in it knows what I mean....it’s just everywhere! 😂).  I do think that a few of the colors are so similar you don’t notice a difference on the eyes. Especially “Dark Orchid” and “Dark Magenta.” I just don’t notice much difference between them. The brush on the other end blends them out well. They last okay on my eyes. I have really hooded eyes, so any type of cream shadow usually creases and wears off within a few hours. These were no different when I used them on their own. But, if I used them together with powder eyeshadow, they lasted well.<br /><br />Overall, you get 6 shadow sticks for $9.99 (at the time of writing this review). If these are colors you like and you want just a wash of color, I’d say go for it! They are smooth and creamy. If you’re looking for something with really good pigment, you’re going to have to really build these up for good pigment. Since there’s other cream stick shadows out there that are much more pigmented without needing to build them up, I wouldn’t really recommend these if you want something with a lot of pigment without needing built up.",1
AE5ESL52LWWBJTSFOAXSFZA3XCGQ,B086TS3BKQ,5,2020-12-24 15:52:39.373,Unique experience,"At first the bar feels a little rough but it smooths out pretty quickly after that.  The lather that comes off of this is pretty intense, but I really like that.  If it's a bar of soap it better lather, and this one does for sure.  I like the shape of the soap, like little shields, because it makes it easy to hold and handle.  I don't know if that was intentional, or a nice unintended consequence of the design, but nonetheless it works well in that regard.  I do wish the bars were a little bigger.  They have the size of something you would get in a hotel, which means you'll go through them rather quickly.  I remained nice and moisturized after my shower, and did not suffer from dry skin from this bar. Does it improve immunity?  Honestly I do not see how, unless you claim it washes away bacteria and viruses from your skin, but any soap will do that.  So I doubt it, but even still I like it, and would use it again.",1

But, I hadn’t seen an at home nail lamp with this high of wattage before, so I was willing to have the shiny gold if I got the high wattage.

I love wearing wigs that look like wigs.<br />But once in awhile, you just want to blend in with the crowd, and wear a wig that simply looks like you've got great hair.<br />Wigs like that generally cost a heck of a lot more than this one. Was really surprised to see how natural this one looks. In a lot of situations, and by that I mean if it isn't windy or super bright sunshine, no one would think this is a wig. That makes it perfect for shopping, work, and most situations.<br />I find this style to be nearly universally flattering on everyone. It doesn't matter if you have a chubby face or a thin face, this style is classic because most people can wear it.<br />Another thing to like is that this wig doesn't get tangled as long as you keep it on a wig stand.<br />Very good value for a very cute wig.",1

I've never owned a 3 barrel iron before so I watched a few videos online while I was waiting for this to arrive. It looked easy enough, though I was questioning the size of the ones they used versus the what I ordered. The barrel is 3/4"" so I knew that would make for a tighter curl regardless and I was ok with that. What I didn't think about was the overall size of the whole thing. It's tiny, like really, really small lol I attached a pic of me holding it, it's like a play curling iron for a child lol BUT it does work! I was able to curl through all of my hair in no time at all and it left me feeling like I got a perm in 10 mins (see pic of my hair straight vs curled)! Not something I'm going to want to do on a regular basis. I think I want more of a relaxed wave for that which means a much larger barrel size, but for special occasions when I do want my hair curly this will do the trick nicely.<br />A separate, tiny complaint is the inability to adjust the heat setting. I have very thin hair and I generally don't use very high heat settings on my other curlers/straighteners but this one was either on or off, no adjustment for heat so I had to make sure to not hold my hair in for too long so I wouldn't risk breaking it off. It's not the most ideal situation but it is a fairly easy fix to just err on the side of not long enough rather than too long.",1

So far it seems to do the trick for me. Cuts down on the time with no burn! Yay! It has a motion activated sensor so it will turn on to the last setting you used when you put your hand (or foot) in, there are several timed settings that countdown (10,30,60 & 99 low heat) or it will count up without selecting one of those to 120 seconds, and the bottom detaches to do pedicures.

I also like that it has a fantastic cool toned set of colors that do not end up showing up blue or purple on the skin. The undertones are very subtle, just like real skin! So hard to find - there seems to be a profusion of warm toned makeup out there, but very little cool or neutral toned makeup that produces a smooth, natural looking and flattering gradient of color on the skin.

I love the fact it comes with black polish.  The black is sheer but that is kind of a plus with this set because it allows buildable color.  You may not want a dark black behind the glitter.  A couple of the colors are similar and unless they are side by side it's harder to tell them apart but overall I love it. I really love the fact that I can have beautiful glitter nails without the scratchy feel.  I would order Pine products again.  They don't smell bad either.,1
AEGKJTQWHGBIOTO34OB3GKIGCN7A,B08G83G24X,4,2020-12-29 00:55:35.121,Adorable for DYI gifts,I like making my own hand lotions and sanitizers and these little keychain lotion bottle and holders are just adorable for those projects. What’s really nice about them is they make a nice gift for a guy and a lot of these types of holders are way too feminine to give to a guy as a gift. Any patriot would certainly love it.  The price? I found it to be fair for the novelty that it is.,1

The presentation is great, with it opening like a big book full of sparkly, colorful nail supplies, and pictures of her favorite characters everywhere. The nail polish works great, with most of them showing up really well on little nails (some of the glitter ones aren't as noticeable, as with any nail polish). They dry pretty quickly, and the dryer helps. They also peel off pretty easily, which can be a plus or a minus. After about a day half of them are coming off. The stickers are tiny, so they should fit anyone! Very pleased with this product.",1

But you got to have some practice to follow this approach. Otherwise, it will take you forever to distribute and mold your nails.<br /><br />All poly gels come sealed. They do match the color listed on the outside of the little bottle.

The handle holds a AA battery, not included. Once the battery is put in, you choose a head and turn the device on. It vibrates rather than spins and it does an amazing job cleaning my face. I really like the silicone head because it cleans but it also feels great. The brush head is a bit abrasive and not as comfortable but does clean deeper.<br /><br />Because the brush is waterproof, I can use it in the shower. It also has a stand so I can leave it upright in the stand when finished. I also like not having to charge it.",1

It provides very little coverage, and if you try to build it up, it looks cakey and separates. It also made my skin oily. I do think it helped protect my skin from the sun, though.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the sponge soaked with product, because it makes it unnecessarily hard to extract, and seems like a waste.<br /><br />The packaging itself looks really nice, and I feel fancy pulling the pretty compact out of my purse.

I don't wear much makeup, but I do pencil my eyes and brows daily and sometimes wear eyeshadow.  I love the ingredients, the fact that it's fragrance-free and free from animal testing.

AES3YWD3ONJOUDRWFIV2ZO44QDAQ,B08LYT4Q2X,2,2020-12-31 11:44:55.648,These are not USDA certified oils. 2 stars ✨,"First, I will say these oils seem fine. They work well together or apart, mixed into other skincare products or alone. I use these types of oils to make my own facial oil mix or to add to my moisturizer.<br />The thing I absolutely hate that companies do to try to sell their products is to say things that aren't true. The USDA does not certify oils - food, cosmetic, or otherwise. The fact that the bottle says this product is USDA certified on one side, and the other side says not intended for ingestion should speak volumes. The USDA certifies and regulates the welfare and production of food products; meaning products that you ingest. So, why on earth would they certify a product you cannot ingest? The bottle also makes outright claims of known cures from using these oils. There is no disclaimer on either bottle that states that these claims have not been approved or proven by the FDA, or whatever the disclaimer is that is mandatory. There are ingredients listed, one ingredient for each product, the oil, and that's it. Nothing tells how these oils were extracted. Therefore, we do not know if they are refined or unrefined. They probably don't know either. So you see, therein lies the lies and deception.<br />These oils would be much better if they weren't tied to lies. Because you know what they say about lies... if you tell one you have to tell more to keep up with the first one. Is what they say in the bottle really what's in the bottle? Are they pure oils or mixed with a lesser oil? Oils are greasy. If they are unrefined, why aren't they greasy? When you refine oils, you take away a lot of their natural properties and their nutritive value, is that why they aren't greasy? Because of the lies and lack of important information, I really don't know for sure what these oils are.<br />Because of the deceptive practices and claims made, I would not recommend these or any of their other oils.",0

I prefer to use the micro needle roller first. It isn’t the most comfortable feeling, but you get use to it. I do it while I am watching T.V. To distract myself. While rolling, I put the jade roller in the refrigerator. Once I finish with the micro needle, I apply hyaluronic acid, and then roll with the jade roller. It is SO SOOTHING. The roller has two sides- a large end for the planes of your face, and a small end to get in smaller areas like under your eyes. I only use the micro needle roller once a week-usually on Saturday nights. It does make your face a little red, but it goes away by morning. I use the jade roller a couple times a week, especially after stressful days. Just so you know, make sure to sterilize both rollers or you will have major breakouts from spreading bacteria around. I keep alcohol in a small spritzer to use on both before each use. The  packaging was sufficient, and I would feel comfortable giving it as a gift.",1

I know these are nail brushes, but I have found some nail brush products to not only be prettier in the hand, but also to last longer than standard watercolor brushes so I will order brushes like this on occasion.<br /><br />This set has it's pros & cons. The blue colored brush has a very disappointing brush head. After only one use the bristles started to fray.  The amber colored detail brush works great with no issues, same with the pink colored blunt brush. None of the heads are particularly large. The light blue is nice for little details.<br /><br />Knowing that watercolor is much more gentle to use, the fact that one of these brushes frays makes me wonder how well they will hold up to much more rough chemical nail use. Something you might want to keep in mind when considering your brush options.<br /><br />The overall look of the brushes is very nice.

Hate to say it but nasal sprays have been the one and only thing that tends to relieve the congestion.  Usually once a day before bedtime.  Ordered this product to give it a shot.  I followed the instructions and added the product (actually two products) to a hot bath and hopped in.  Sat soaking for about 15 minutes with no relief.  Then I put a muslin washcloth over my face and started pouring hot bath water over it.  After about five minutes of deep breathing (in through the nose, out through the mouth) the nasal congestion started breaking up somewhat.  Didn't completely break up but got better.  Drained the tub (tons of sandy debris left) and took a hot shower to rinse the clay, etc, off.  That's when the congestion broke loose.  I was able to blow my nose and breath through my nose with very little to no congestion.  Unfortunately the relief didn't last all that long, probably about three hours.  At 36 bucks a pop, that's 12 dollars per hour for three hours relief.  Pass, I can buy a lot of nasal spray for $36.",0

I'm not even sure I'd want to use this on a sunburn.<br /><br />So anyway, I've used it on other parts of my body that weren't zapped by radiation instead.  I like the smell.

I've tried quite a few different tweezers, but my favorite is an old Revlon one that I've had for more than 15 years.  To me, it's not just about the angle or the point - it's the gripping power.  This LeiCare set works well and have become my go-to splinter removers.  They grip well and for the price (currently $6.99 for both tweezers and the case), I think these are a good deal.  My only complaint is with the case.  It's basically cardboard so while it's held up so far, I don't think it will last long.  If you lose the little ""straps"" that hold the tweezers closed, the case won't close.",1

However, that is not what this is at all. There are 10 tiny balls of compressed flowers wrapped in various colored foils. They can be used as a tea, which is what I use them for, or they can be put in a bath. I have no idea how anyone would use this for baking as per the Amazon title.<br /><br />Nevertheless, all but the purple and red balls have a purely vegetal scent. The purple and red smell flowery. I have used tea balls before and never cared for them but did like how most stayed together. However, these balls expand into many little flower particles that float in the water. If one were to put this in a bath, it would clog the drain unless the flower debris was scooped out with a skimmer.  I used the blue ball to brew into a tea and it was tasteless. I also had to use a strainer and remove the lid on my pot to keep the spout from clogging.<br /><br />Besides the mess and lackluster flavor, there are absolutely no brewing instructions, no information on what tea ball is what flower.  The Amazon site has a list of the flower and the balls but does not show the foil color. It is almost impossible to reconcile that list with what is in front of me.<br /><br />Shame on the vendor for not creating an insert or package label that says what is inside and which tea ball is what flower. I personally do not care for this at all and will probably throw this in the garbage.<br /><br />This is not worth it to me at any price. It is certainly not a bath bomb, I can't see how it can be used for baking, and as a tea it is tasteless and messy. There is no fragrance, so its use as a bath bomb would be for romantic or ambiance purposes only.<br /><br />At the current price of $9.88 for 10 balls it comes to almost $1 per tea ball.",0

Also included is a glass tube with a dropper head so they can be used for liquids that must be dispensed drop by drop, such as essential oils.

First let me say that I do like the idea - i love it in fact.  I was so excited about receiving this product because it was so different and unique.  I wanted to learn how to use this product in different ways.  When I received it, I got the bag as pictured above and couldn't figure out what was inside.  There was no description on the outside at all.  I didn't know what was inside till I ripped the bag open. After I opened it, I immediately saw the beautifully colored foil wrapped buds and remembered ""Oh yes, this is the flower buds that I saw that can be used as tea, bath pods and for baking.""  There was no description, instructions or anything inside other than the beautifully foil wrapped buds.  I'm still left wondering how I will use them.  If I use for tea, I suppose I just wing it and drink the tea when I think it's done as there's no recipe for how long to steep to experience the perfect amount of flavor is extracted.  If I use for a bath, I'm sure there would be much more flexibility but it also advertises you can use for baking.  I have no idea how to use it for that.  If I wanted to use it for a gift, it would be incomplete not to mention that in order to even know what I ordered, I had to already open the pretty bag so that would ruin the presentation.  I feel this is a great product with great potential to be a high end gift or luxury indulgence.  They just have one more step to complete in the way of instructions and explanation on the packaging to make it achieve it's potential.  This idea could easily go viral and become very popular.",0

These cover in one easy coat and have a nice glossy finish. The glitter polish was a little bit thick, but it's packed with glitter so I guess that's to be expected. This set of six shades contains (1) Glitter, (3) Crèmes, (2) Magnetics, and a cats eye magnet wand needed to work the magnetic polishes. All of the colors cure for 60 secs in an LED lamp or 90 secs in a UV.<br /><br />The crèmes are all buttery smooth in application, and self level beautifully. Each dry down to a nice glossy finish. The magnetics are easy to manipulate with the enclosed magnet stick. I was able to do a double cat eye line on my first try! (These are gonna be a lot of fun to play with using different shaped magnets for different effects.) Both magnetic polishes covered completely in one easy coat. The glitter shade is jam-packed with small royal blue glitters and is accented with a sprinkling of medium sized blue hexagons. The depth and sparkle to this polish is incredible. The glitter load makes this shade a little bit thick - but it's still workable. None of these gel polishes have a bad odor. None of them gave me any issues during application or the curing process. I cannot speak to the wear time, as I always use a peel-off base coat or full coverage tips, with gel polish products.<br /><br />Because these are so rich in pigment, (and a lot of them are dark colors), it is best to work in thin coats. They do cure with a sticky layer. All of these (except the glitter) cured for 60 sec in my LED lamp. With the thickness and opacity of the glitter polish, I did a double cure on that one to be safe. All swatches in this review are ONE coat and are shown WITHOUT top coat.<br /><br />I think the coverage, formula, and finishes of these polishes is amazing and absolutely worth the price.

My favorite gels are by Patchology as I get amazing results. The GenSkin marine algae gels seem good quality and they do make my skin feel soft, but I don’t see the obvious plumping benefits I get with the Patchology gels and these gels also don’t feel as comforting or refreshing. I’ve even compared by wearing one of each brand at the same time, and my skin with the Patchology gel gets superior results as my lines barely show.<br /><br />These GenSkin gels are deep blue and have added colorant (which is typical).

Most ingredients rate low risk by EWG (other than fragrance, colorant and preservative). These seem good, but I just don’t get the comfort or obvious plumping and hydration I get with Patchology gels. So these are just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in China.",0

Functional misting spray bottle.","Even though these spray bottles look like giant pills (capsules), they are not a pill to operate. The set of 8, 4 of each color, has a clear bootle, with a pastel color (pink and blue) snap on top. In addition, there is a small clear cap that covers the spray head. So, in effect, there are 2 caps that cover the spray bottle. Hopefully, if there is a leak, either one or both caps will contain the liquid.<br />Even though the spray bottle looks like capsule, the bottom of the bottle is flattened, so it can stand upright. I was initially concerned about this when I first examined the product.<br />Using water as a test, the spray bottle emitted a fine spray; perhaps a bit more than a misting. It would excellent for a spritz of fragrance. I cannot say how well it will deal with thicker liquids, like oils. But, the product details state that it's fine for essential oils.<br />These are cute, and individually wrapped. As such, they are perfect for gift bags. They are cute and have good quality manufacture. The set of 8 spray bottles receives a 4.5 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1

The capacity of each bottle is 16 ounces. Keep in mind that this is glass, not plastic. There are inherent advantages to using glass, such are durability and environmental concerns. Also, glass will not chemically interact with most liquids (however, caution is still necessary since the spray top and mechanism is composed of plastic). The disadvantage is that this kind of glass bottle is heavier than comparative plastic bottles. The amber color protects the contents from light (sunlight and uv exposure). My view is this type of spray bottle is more on the premium end of the scale.<br />Included accessories: 4 regular screw on tops, 1 screw on eye dropper top, funnel, labels and marker. Each of the bottles comes with the plastic spray top already installed. I appreciate the regular tops, which effect a better seal than the spray tops, which will protect the contents from spills, evaporation and contaminants. I wish they provided at least 2 of the eye dropper tops, but I guess even getting one, when the the product is sold as spray bottles, is a bonus.<br />The sprayer mechanism can actually rotate, it's not a one piece sprayer top, the screw on segment is separate from the spraying segment. This is not a cheap spraying cap.<br />The set of 4 amber color glass bottles fully matches the descriptions and pictures in the product details. At $34, these are a bit pricey, but the glass is substantial, not thin.<br />Overall, these are impressive, and appear to be a premium variation of spray bottle. And priced accordingly.<br />These spray bottles receive a solid 4.5 star rating.",1

I personally wouldn't wear this on it's own since it's quite sheer, but it's perfect for putting over a color. I ordered this set because my 3 year old LOVES all things sparkly, so it's perfect for kicking solid colors up a notch and making them fabulous enough for a preschooler. It took two coats to get enough sparkles for her taste. It's kind of tricky to get them even, which for makes my inner perfectionist feel a little crazy, but she's 3 and doesn't care. The sparkles are almost holographic so they are intensely sparkly. These nail colors arrive in a nice box with a foam cutout for each bottle. My only complaint about the packaging is that nowhere on the bottles does it say the name of or show the color. There are color dots included if you'd like to make your own color dot for each bottle, but I would much prefer that it arrive with the color on the bottle already so I don't have to. I don't understand why you wouldn't include the color on the bottle. Other than that I'm happy with these.",1

Excellent color selection, with base and top coat bottles.","The manner of presentation raises it's value as a gifting option. This is a fairly good assortment of color poly gel polishes, including 2 tubes of temperature changing polishes (an addition not usually found in beginner sets). Small jars of base coat and top coat (10ml each) complete the liquid components of this set.  2 nail art tools are included: a two sided positioning pen and nail file board (the rather large pink item in the attached photos).<br />The gel poly polishes come in 15ml (0.5fl oz) tubes. The colors cover the range of popular hues. The gel poly tends to be on the thicker side. For a beginner to intermediate user, perhaps the best approach is to use slip solution or alcohol. Put a small quantity of alcohol or slip solution into a small bowl/container. Apply some gel polish then dip your brush into the alcohol, and smooth out the polish. The alcohol or slip solution acts as a solvent to loosen up the polish, enabling the user to manipulate the polish more easily. It's better to deal with a gel polish that is too thick, than a circumstance of the polish being too loose/thin. Also, gel poly is a different product than regular liquid nail polish.<br />Overall, a very good set for beginners. Intermediate users will find use for the colors, especially the temperature based color changing varieties. And top coat and base coat bottles are always handy to have as additional resources.<br />Based on these considerations, this set obtains a solid 4 star rating.",1

The glass is thick and, while it's certainly not immune to breaking, it can deal with the occasional bump without a problem. Having it be tinted brown is great for limiting the amount of UV that can enter, plus gives it a nice look.  The caps are excellent and provide a good seal. The sprayers are just OK. They work, but are not all that heavy-duty. I'm using these more for storage than application, so I'm more interested in the cap seal than the sprayer.<br /><br />It also comes with a very useful funnel, a dropper and a white marker. The funnel is something that I'll use often; I won't use the others. But, it's a nice complement of accessories.<br /><br />The bottles come very well packaged with two layers of bubble pack, and are in a box that's the right size to prevent things from moving around.

It just seemed like it would be difficult to get one without the other. But really, it's not too bad.<br /><br />The colors go on pretty well, even the lighter color does. They go on in a narrower line, of course, but then you can take your finger, or a brush, and spread it out to look more like an eyeshadow rather than a pencil. It's a little harder to apply under the eyes when you have a pencil design like this, but it's doable. (It is a powder, though, so it doesn't stay very well underneath the eyes.)<br /><br />Overall, pretty colors, interesting pencil design, and a good product that I can recommend.",1

They also include a base, as well as glossy and matte no-wipe topcoats (both of which are phenomenal!) The glossy top is super shiny and the matte top looks like velvet.<br /><br />Rosegin curated a lovely rainbow assortment of mini gel colors in this set. You get pastels and primary colors, but no black or white polish is included. The bottles are 5ml; though they look tiny, they're filled to the top and contain enough product for several mani's. I swatched 12 out of the 20 shades in this kit and the formulas are amazing! Smooth and buttery. Beautifully pigmented - 2 coats to full coverage. The glitters aren't thick or clumpy, and don't leave bald spots during application. The brushes fan out nicely on the nail and make the polishes easy to control. There is no offensive odor to any of these and they cured within 60 secs in my LED lamp. I cannot speak to the wear time with these as I always wear a peel-off base or full cover tips with gel polish products.<br /><br />I've shown both the glossy and matte top coats with my swatches.

This ""chalfont 303- a shimmering shade of pearl"" reminds more of a yellow tinged shimmery champagne rather than what I think of as pearl (white leaning pink). It is definitely not a white pink, too bad.  I may use it blended in with something, but it otherwise looks sallow on my fair, pink skin with blue undertones.

The bottles come with 3 in clear, 1 blue, 1 green and 1 pink. It's a good mix, and the clear probably being the most versatile, since you'll be able to view the quantity and more easily identify the contents.<br />The silicone appears to be very good quality, is soft enough to easily squeeze, but firm enough to retain it's shape. Plus the tactile qualities of the silicone is very nice. The screw cap has a hinged topper that has a plug that fits snugly into the spout. The cap screws onto a hard plastic threaded piece. It's a relatively simple design that just works well.<br />Using plain water as a test, there was not a single drop of leakage. A very good sign. I did not abuse the bottle, and I'm sure that with enough pressure on the silicone bottle the cap could open, or there could be a leak. But, under normal circumstances I don't see leaks happening.<br />These are ideal to keep handy good quantities of hand sanitizer, hand lotion, creams, essential oils. I like the idea of the belt clip and the general design of the bottle.<br />Examination of the bottles found uniform construction, with no defects or flaws. These are cute and functional.<br />These silicone squeeze bottles earn a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1
AEQJM4TTCTH6MTHXAUQHIZ4JZZHA,B08DXCVRNY,5,2021-01-09 11:08:50.982,I've found the BEST BB CREAMS from Korean beauty brands & this is no exception!!,"So, I'm recently 50 (I'm wondering how long I'll keep adding recently to my age??) and during 2020 I fell in love with Korean skin care and Korean BB Creams.  This one gets high marks, and it's a bit different than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I ordered the lightest shade since I'm VERY fair and it worked perfectly.  That's one of the things I love about BB Creams in general, they provide coverage but they also seem to work with your skin tone rather than masking it.  This applied beautifully with a brush and my fingers (my preferred method).  I'm assuming it would work with a damp sponge, as well.  On me that tends to look cakey for some reason, so I don't generally go that route.  It worked well over multiple moisturizers and both of my favorite sunscreens.  I use a primer occasionally and had no problems with application when I did.  It goes on smoothly and blends out easily.  It's a very light formula and feels like I'm not even wearing makeup.  It doesn't have a high amount of coverage.  I would call it a buildable medium, as far as that goes.  Now, here's where it differs from the other Korean BB Creams I've tried.....it dries down to a very satin, skin like finish.  Most others end up with either a dewy or slightly luminous finish, which is fine.  This is the first one I've found that doesn't.  It's definitely not a matte finish, though.<br /><br />It wears really well.  I can get a full 10 hours of wear out of it, whether I set it or not.  That's another thing about the way this drys down, if you tend toward dry skin (I do) then you can get away with not powdering this one if that's your preference.  When I do use powder I go in pretty lightly, and usually just in the areas where my pores might be having a particularly ""showy"" day with a blurring powder.  The bonus that seems to come with most Korean beauty facial products is the SPF.  This is a PA+++/SPF 50+.  Now that doesn't mean I skip my normal sunscreen, cause you're never gonna convince me that what you get in foundation or BB Cream is adequate protection.....but I will never say no to MORE protection.  EVER.<br /><br />This is a beautiful BB Cream that works really well on aging skin, so I imagine it would be a dream on younger skin,  perfect or textured alike.  One other thing I noticed is that at the end of the day I still hardly noticed I was wearing makeup.  And when I washed it off my skin felt and looked pretty good.  It wasn't dried out and didn't have that worn out look that I've gotten used to seeing after a full day in makeup.  Definitely a keeper!!",1

So far, so good.<br /><br />The thing I worry about most with a little bottle like this is what happens if you put a lot of pressure on it (sit on it, lean against the wall when it's in a pocket or on a belt loop, etc). I was concerned that the flip top would pop open and I'd end up with hand sanitizer all over the place, but I tested these little guys full of liquid before filling with sanitizer. The pliability of the silicone doesn't allow a burst of pressure to push off the flip top-- not even close. Plus, the top screws tightly into place. It's not going anywhere.<br /><br />I've been using one of these hanging from my purse strap for the last few days and it is super easy to flip the cap, squeeze out product, and flip the cap closed with one hand. Wish there were other color options, but the functionality and design of these override any concerns about color. I'm so glad I ordered these! They are totally worth the price.",1

I usually pay about $5 for a bag of Epsom salt that's good for 4-5 baths.  That's about $1 per soak.  The Pursoma Digital Detox Bath Soak did about as much to relax me and relief pain as the Epsom salt and with the Epsom salt I don't have to shower to remove the ""mud"" and rinse out the mud/dirt from the tub after using it.  I suspect more of the relaxation comes from the hot water and length of time a person soaks as it does from any additive put in the water.  With the Epsom salt baths I can also add in a bath bomb for a couple bucks more and enjoy the aroma and moisturizing effects of the bomb.  I'll stick with my routine.",0

I have just made my first attempt at using gel polish and I am loving the results and longevity gels provide. I did a few simple polka dots on my nails to test out these nail tools. It worked out just fine.  I like that the glitter is inside the base so that the outside is smooth to the touch. The different colors also makes it easy to differentiate between the various sizes at a glance. Next time I'll use the brush end to add some stripes. The metal end was easy to clean with just the wipe of a cotton ball. I'll clean the brush side with soap a water when using gels and acetone when using regular polish.",1

BUT its a little hard to determine if they should be a tea or a bath enhancer.  They are NOT bath bombs.  Each mini ball (they are close to a quarter in size maybe a bit smaller) is wrapped in jewel color foil paper.  They do each have a fantastic natural floral smell that did not have a chemical scent, to me, in any way.<br /><br />I have a large 2 person soaker tub.  I would need to use pretty much all of these to get a nice overall effect.  However, a standard bath tub you could probably use 1 or 2.<br /><br />For tea or baking these would be better.  I am not personally a fan of floral flavored food but many people I know are.  In order to bake with these you prep like a tea, strain, press and use liquid for flavor.  Set flowers aside and add to batter once it's been poured to maintain shape.  OR add to mix if only want the color.<br /><br />Its a little overpriced IMO but very good quality.",0

Much to my surprise, it took about the same amount of time to spiral curl my hair as what it does to straighten it. It heats up really nicely, does not pull out pieces of my hair, and did not make it frizzy. I like the barrel size because it doesn't give me those tight ""poodle"" curls, and leaves a soft wavy flow behind (I have super long hair). Overall for the price this is an excellent value, especially if you are just looking for a tool to occasionally change up your look. Very happy with its quality and the end result.",1

Poly Gel nails remind me a lot of acrylics, but are a little bit easier to apply, and you can get good length without having to use artificial tips. I was worried not using tips would make them more prone to breaking but so far I have not had that issue.<br /><br />Using the liquids and the nail shapers, its actually quite easy to put on. I've had relatively good luck getting them to last about the same length of time as acrylics, roughly 2 weeks. This set has some nice color options and seems to be high quality. Overall I'd recommend to anyone wanting fancy nails but to save some money, to definitely try at home manicures at home, using this set is a great place to start. Its important to know though that you need a UV light which is not included with this kit. Regardless, I still recommend it!",1

For tea? - I don't think so,"First off for anything touting that they are Organic and then come in a non-descript bag - no ingredients, no country of origin or manufacture - no brand info, etc. that is SUPER sketchy.  Seriously doubt these are Organic - no marking as such - but there is no info whatsoever anyway - so who knows what is truly in them.<br /><br />I put a ball in my glass mug and poured boiling water anyway.  There is no ""flowering"" like you may get from flowering tea balls.  It just sort of filled the entire mug with flowers - petals and flowers.  Like the entire mug.  It was the consistency of a thick stew.  You might get a few sips for the space that is left after the flowers expand.  I was actually impressed with how much ""flower"" was there from that tiny and light ball.<br /><br />I sipped it and was snot impressed with the flavor.  Light at that and must have been chamomile as chamomile smells like chicken soup to me and I am not a fan of chamomile or this ""tea"".  It was the consistency of soup, though... a hearty chowder.  It was not fragrant in any way either so I think although you get plenty of flowers for a tub - you are defeating the purpose of adding fragrant flower petals to your bath.  Plus no ingredients anyway.  It seemed like all flowers - it really did - but I am not really sure what is in there.  Plus some people are allergic to certain herbs and flowers anyway.  This one is a bust...<br /><br />If you found my review helpful - why not click the ""Helpful"" button?  Thanks! : )",0

Also, there are buttons on each side of the ear area. When I attach my mask to these buttons, my face mask is no longer tight to my face because the slinky velvet material moves and does not stay in place.<br /><br />Overall, I do not like these at all. They will suffice as headbands only and not for mask attachment. The current price of $11.99 comes to $2 per band but I do not feel they are worth that price at all.",0

You have to slide it on a couple of times to get good pigmentation payoff however once you use the brush to blend it out the color slowly fades and leaves you with a sheer looking shadow. You will need to reapply a couple of times to have good coverage. Overall the colors and finish are cute however the execution could use some work.

I had plenty left on my hands to do my neck and behind my ears after I completed my face.  the thing I LOVE most about black wolf products is that they remember that all eyes are not created equal... yes I said eyes... my 42 year old eyes can not see most directions on the bottles that come in.  these guys must know how I feel b/c they ALWAYS type them in a very large font, which is great b/c it saves me from having to call my boyfriend through Alexa to come in and read them to me!!!

AEQKG4FNUB67X4JUBJRWT3ISVKDQ,B089QR2Y5B,4,2021-01-12 13:44:57.912,Cute Headbands and great value,"This was an ok set of headbands for the money and at a good value. The set came with 10 hairbands, which equaled out to be cheaper than buying them individually. I got them to split up as gifts between my daughter and my nieces.<br /><br />My daughter and I love all of the colors and think the knot style is really cute, but I feel that the quality is not the same for all of the headbands. Some are perfect, but some are not. The knots were not in the same spots on all of them. Some had knots on the top in the middle and then some of the knots were slightly off to the side. Also the fabric on some are glued on slightly crooked and some are a smaller size then the others.  So a couple of them were too small for my daughters head. Even though some have a few minor issues, she says she still loves the ones I gave her. So I am at least happy about that. She does wear them all the time and they do look flattering on her. The only thing is the flower print ones she has a harder time matching to her outfits, so she usually wears those ones with a solid color shirt. My nieces are also happy with theirs. The ones that were actually too small for my daughter were the ones that I gifted to my nieces, which turned out great because they fit both of my nieces good. <br /><br />Overall I am ok with this set. They were a great money saver and great for gifting. The hairbands are cute and little girls love them. Even with the few minor flaws I would still get them again.",1
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,B08PPB3W6H,4,2021-01-12 17:37:06.937,Good to not slip from your hair,"These headbands are completely necessary for me to live my life these days.  I tried other masks extenders but nothing either stayed put, was comfortable, or actually helped with my mask.  I have a few different types of mask headbands now - as I wear one every time I leave my house.<br /><br />These particular ones are pretty nice!  If you have a problem with slicker material ones slipping out of your hair - THESE will stay put due to the velour grip on your head.  They are not too tight either - some bands I tried squish your brain...  The buttons are also the NICEST buttons I have seen on a mask headband like ever.  The ONLY flaw with the pretty and matching buttons that are sort of concave are that because of their pretty design once you put your mask strap on them they sort of lift up and away from the band itself (because of their concaveness) - so sort of stick out a bit.  So the pretty buttons can be a flaw.  But they work just fine - and it is probably me being anal.<br /><br />The buttons are also at a decent placement.  I wish they were the slightest bit lower, though - as that works best for me.  As they are now they are still good - any higher and they would be pulling your nose up by your mask.  The colors (other than the wilder animal print) are muted enough to easily wear to the office as well.  A headband is literally part of my everyday office wear now.

I am not a professional at all and can barely paint my own nails. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before giving this a try and I didn't do terrible! Here are some pointers for those of you that are trying this out for the first time.<br />1) you need to have a uv/led curing light. You start with the clear base and cure it before applying the gel. Apply the gel and cure, then apply the top coat and cure.<br />2) thick but not too thick!- If you make it too thin, the tips will just bend and break off. You need to make sure that you are putting it on about the consistency of the plastic nail that you use to apply the gel.<br />3) Don't forget to fix the bottom of the nail tip before you cure. If you don't do this you will have a giant glob of hardened get that you will need to file down.<br />4) If you don't want an ombre effect, you will need to make sure that the thickness is consistent from the top to the bottom of the nail.<br />5) Have a few disposable nail files. The giant one that comes with the kit isn't my favorite because it is quite bulky. I used a few coarse nail files to really get the shape that I wanted.<br /><br />The kit itself is nicely put together, I just wish there were directions with it. You will need to have a lamp, nail file, cuticle cutter, and nail trimmers to accomplish your finished nails which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.",1

The smaller one I use gently around my eyes.  But I mostly use it on my eyebrows with growth serum.  I roll the area first, apply the serum and roll again.

The creams are nice and opaque though, this was a one coater in the pic. I did like that there was a white crelly even though after 3 coats it still wasn't opaque. Ultimately this is an average set. The small size of the bottles and the sheerness of the glitters makes it a 3 star product. There are too many other sets out there that are better to put this one at the top of the list but because of the number of polishes that also includes base/top coats it's still better than others.",0
AG4D44BNNLUEZNG7COK2CNRYUHYQ,B08NPBQR9L,2,2021-01-14 21:43:43.324,Why???,"I was excited to get this because my girls are at an age where they like to play with hairstyles.  I tried using this on my youngest who has thinish straight hair and it basically 'crimped' her hair.  No curls.  Just flat straight lines where the iron ended and a slight wave in between each line.  Also, it only has 1 temp setting - high making it is easy to damage your hair.<br /><br />So, yes, this thing is small and you can tuck it into your suitcase but I'm not sure why anyone would bother since it is essentially useless.",0

I love that it is made with all natural ingredients and that it feels so light on the skin. I have been using it for the past few days and it has added an extra level of moisture and plump to my skin. It does not clogs pores and it has a pleasant and natural scent.

I don't really ""like"" it, but I don't dislike it either. It's just kind of medicinal. I do like the size of the bars which fit neatly in my hand. Not that anyone can travel anymore due to the pandemic...but if we could, this would be a nice travel size soap. Each bar lasted me through about three showers. Take it out of the shower after each use so that it doesn't stay damp and melt away. It has a rather unusual texture; a bit grainy like it's made of baking soda. It lathers nicely though which is a bit surprising given the texture. Overall, I like it.",1
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B06ZYWVSZY,5,2021-01-15 16:59:04.227,"excellent at evening out rosy skin, great smelling tinted mineral sunscreen, great as primer","Interesting product! I have used another rose tinted sunscreen before and was intrigued enough by it to try another. This one might be even better. Let me tell you about it in terms of my ROSACEA (type 1: redness, and visible veins/telangiectasias). I would not thinking adding MORE PINK would be at all helpful to my already rosy complexion. But it does a phenomenal job evening out my skin tone.  I have fair, cool toned skin so I find this is still a tad dark-- so if you have skin that is even a little darker than very pale, then this should blend in real well. Yet even with the clearly pink mask that it gives me, it looks better than pink and red splotches. I just wouldnt go out in public with this alone. SO, this got me thinking about using it as a BASE layer to another sunscreen, mixing it, or the best use.. using it under make up. It will provide a great foundational canvas for a layer of foundation. Wont need to rely on the make up to even things out. If you have splotchiness, you may like trying this out. That's what appeals greatest to me-- that it evens out my skin tone gently.<br /><br />Nice smell, even coverage.. makes my skin feel really good. Semi dewy supple feel. My skin is DRY, and this feels good on, Maybe it just plays well with my other skin care products? Oddly.. it has a slight gritty feel while putting it on. Yet doesnt have a gritty feel ON the skin. Not sure what I am feeling. Its odd.. but it doesnt impact overall look, feel, or performance.",1

My little cousin loves seeing her older cousin do nails and I wanted her to start with something a little bit easier to work with that’s why I chose polygel because you can take as long as you need to work it around to your liking and no matter how messed up it may be you can file it into shape. It even gives nice gel color polishes to choose from and some pretty decors to add. She’s gonna love it!

It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower.<br /><br />The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because the title says this is exfoliating and I do not consider that an attribute of this brush. The bristles are too soft to exfoliate. However, it cleans well and feels great to use. I consider it 5 stars for that purpose.  The current price of $16.99 is on the pricey side but I have no similar brush of this bristle style to compare it to. It is certainly not competitively priced with other back brushes which are about $7 cheaper.",1

A nice touch, rope is wound around the lower end of the handle for a more secure grip. This is useful when in the bath or shower, and water could make any handle slippery.<br />The only thing I'd change would be for a bit larger brush head. The diameter is approximately 3 inches. It's fine, but a larger brush head would be better.<br />The brush does lather up nicely, and feels nice against the skin. Time and use will determine the durability of the brush head.

Castor oil is wonderful for hair and skin and I use a lot of it in my hand made soaps because it makes them very emollient and soothing to the skin.  This is a huge bottle of shampoo and will last me a long time.  It makes very good lather - nice and light and it rinses out well.  My hair is very clean afterwards.  I still use a good conditioner afterwards because my hair is a little damaged from being lightened.  This shampoo has a very light scent too.  There's nothing negative I can find to say about it.,1

They are pretty (at least the darker solids, I threw the other ones away as I'll never use them) and they are a soft velvet and do have button for your mask loops to hook on to. That was the main reason I ordered these because I'm tired of my ears getting sore being in the medical field having to wear a mask for over 8 hours at a time. I do feel lole the velvet helps it stay in place more than the regular cotton or polyester ones but velvet is thick and makes me sweat. Not only that but the way the headband is designed there isnt much stitching to hold the buttons in the position you need them to be in order to hook your mask on. It rolls back on my scalp and then the buttons can get caught in my hair so I have to slide it forward and fidget with it a bit to get it right but for the entirety of my shift I did keep it on and it kept my mask in place comfortably with no problem. I wish the design was a bit different and the velvet maybe a little bit thinner but overall I like these.",0

The clips come in three colors: black, gold, and matte silver. You get two of each color. I have extremely long hair and I wear it up 95% of the time. The clips hold well – wet or dry hair. They're not huge or bulky. I've tried many clips. As for these, they're perfect! Best hair accessory. I don't leave home without one.",1

As far as the mirror, it folds open easily enough and its lightweight. The light modes are handy and while I wish it had a rechargeable battery, i know theyre not common in mirrors of this price range. I don’t think i like the touch button being on the mirror itself, but its not too bad since its lower down.

It is free of parabens, phthalates, mineral oil, gluten, formaldehyde and vegan friendly.<br /><br />You use this mask like you use most. Clean your face and apply it to the cleaned face. Then leave it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and after you removed it gently massage In the remaining serum. This mask has a good amount of serum on it so you can easily leave it on for 20 minutes without having to worry that it will dry out, you could probably go longer yet. My face was a bit sticky afterwards but that feeling did go away after about  minutes or so. The serum in the mask had a pleasant smell that I did like a lot.

Being able to address different issues with these different masks in nice, however I didn’t really see that much of an improvement with just one mask to be honest. But my face did feel great after I used these masks since they were nicely hydrated and felt refreshed after each use.",1
AGXMWJK3YL4SV5FJ27JEJZPZHRBA,B08LPC1G23,5,2021-01-23 18:59:10.374,Effortless Auto-rotating Curling Iron with Three Sizes,"The automatic hair curling iron is an excellent tool! I have tried an automatic curler from a differet brand but this I love because it comes with three different curling irons for the different curl thicknesses. Instead of having three separate curling irons, you have one device with the option to switch out as you choose.<br /><br />It's an easy set up. You just push down the curl iron of choice into the barrel, then rotate the tip of the wand to lock it in place, then change the heat temperature from the bottom knob. You will notice the color change to red when it heats up, but the color will stay green when plugged in even if you ""turn it off.""<br /><br />Most curlers are already heavy and tiring enough to hold and rotate up in the air, but this hair styling tool eliminate the need. All you have to do it hold it up and make it rotate. You slide a section of your hair in between the crowns and press the rotate the button to the left or right, depending on the direction of the curls you want to shape. One thing I love about this device is that, instead of having to clip the hair with standard curling iron that literally leave the end of your curls ""clipped,"" this allows for more natural look as it curls it to the end.<br /><br />I was absolutely happy with the results and the effortless time it took to style my hair. The curls also lasted throughout the day with no problem.",1

I like that these are biodegradable yet they are very sturdy and strong (I tried to rip them by stretching it but it would not rip!).

Icy silver, gold, a plummy/mauve, and a very deep midnight blue.  This shine factor on these packs quite a punch.....I don't think it comes across in the pictures very well, but they definitely are a metallic shadow.  They all are very opaque, but they can be sheered down a bit if you work with them right after you put them on the eye.  They do dry down fairly quickly so it's not something you can take your time to blend out.  I had the best luck applying them with my finger and blending them that way.  I didn't experience any creasing when I wore them and they don't transfer to other areas once they're dried down.  I've worn them for up to 8 hours and they didn't fade or start to slough off the eye.  They're pretty impressive for a liquid shadow.....for a liquid metallic shadow they're DAMNED IMPRESSIVE.",1

First of all, the smell was quite nice - very light but a very nice smell. I actually try to put all the serum that was stuck on the package onto the mask because I wanted more of the nice smell on my face. The mask is soaked in serum and had a little extra left which I scooped out and piled onto the mask on my face. The material of the mask is soft. After 20 minutes it was not dry yet (still damp) but I removed the mask to a very moisturized face. I was able to massage the rest of the serum into my skin and sort of wiped off some of the excess. I really enjoyed using this mask and I’m actually looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />One thing I thought was that this mask is going to be blue colored, as it mentioned about a blue powder (copper peptide?). When I opened the package it was your standard white mask, white serum. It was a little confusing to me with the image of the blue cream in the front and the mention of a blue powder on the back of the packaging.

There are two containers of magnetic eye liner and one plastic tweezers.<br />The eyeliner has a thin brush which makes it simple to paint the black line where it needs to be and keep it straight. I had to go back and re-do the very edges to make sure there was enough to hold the lashes. These are easy to remove from the box with the tweezers and place onto the eyes. I was surprised how well the lashes hold...it's not over grippy but they stay in place as long as you don't knock them around. The felt a bit scratchy along the corner to the nose, although it wasn't really rubbing. This sensation was only slight and soon forgotten.<br /><br />The eyelashes are easy to remove and place back into the box for re-usage. The eyeliner came off so much easier than I thought it would....with a little warm water. It balls off into tiny chunks and doesn't run or scuff or leave marks behind.<br /><br />These work better than I thought they might and I will be using them again.",1

The solution poured out thick, but easily dispersed in the bath, and as long as the water stayed warm, the scent continued to keep my sinuses open.

You get a pack of 6 small shield shaped soaps in a resealable plastic bag. The soaps are about 2.75 inches in length.<br /><br />The scent is strong when you open the bag and especially in the shower. Some of the oils and ingredients included are cloves, cinnamon, oregano, peppermint, parsley, eucalyptus, and rosemary. If you don’t like the smell of cloves, then do not order this because that is the most predominant smell in my opinion. I like it though- it has a nice spicy kick.<br /><br />The soap definitely feels different than I expected. It doesn’t feel really smooth like many soaps. When dry, they were slightly powdery when I ran my finger across. They are slightly gritty feeling which I noticed more once the soap became wet in the shower. This could be nice if you like a slight scrubby feeling. I typically rub it onto my mesh bath sponge or silicone sponge so I don’t really care about the grittiness either way. I found that it lathers and suds up very well with both my mesh and silicone sponges.<br /><br />I just started using, so I’m not sure how many showers I’ll be able to get out of each bar. Honestly, I thought they might disintegrate and get used up fast simply based on how powdery they felt when dry. I don’t think it will last as long as some other soaps, but I was still surprised that I could somewhat see the outline of where the shallow cross was imprinted on the soap even after my first shower-and I did intentionally scrub my sponges all over that side pretty vigorously. I took a picture of what the soap looked like after one shower compared to unused bars.<br /><br />Anyway, my skin feels very clean, perhaps even a little moisturized after using and I haven’t experienced any irritation to my sensitive skin (I have eczema).<br /><br />I like that this soap is natural and free from harmful chemicals. I also love that it is made in the USA-Ohio specifically, which is where I am from.<br /><br />I’ll be sure to update my review if any issues arise like if I find that the bars do in fact get used far too quickly. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!!!",1

Or individual clear totes (so you can see inside). If you do that let them decorate it with stickers. It makes things more fun and takes the fear out of nail trimming for them.<br /><br />I suggest keeping them separate because if one kid gets a nail fungus, athletes foot, hand/foot/mouth then you’re less likely to spread it by not sharing tools.<br /><br />Overall I’m happy with these and would order this kit again.",1

I love that they come with a funnel, labels, marking pen, a dropper, and screw top lids along with the sprayer tops. They work great for making my witch hazel facial toner spray and colloidal silver spray. The sprayers work pretty well, although the sprayer part spins around freely. It makes them feel a little clumsy and uneasy to grab hold of. The price for these is on the high side of what I would normally pay for a set like this. Aside from those couple things, they are very nice quality bottles that come with lots of goodies.",1

I don't think my skin is stressed, but thought it still might be worthwhile. For now, I'm not going out in the world to submit my body to any skin-stressing stuff in the air.  So far, I used the very nice cream at bedtime, and in the morning before applying my makeup.  I really like it under my makeup.  The pure white lightweight moisturizing cream spreads easily and soaks in fast, leaving my face and neck feeling ready for anything (perhaps it's coating is boosting my skin's natural immunity = protection).  There is no stickiness, no sheen, no oiliness, and no noticeable coating, just a comfortable feeling like there's nothing there except a clean face ready for the day.  The 1 oz. container is a frosted glass with a subtle light grayish silver plastic lid.  There is a slight scent that is not objectionable, and doesn't last.  (On the bottom is the expiration date of 6/2021 - not a lot of time - this is 1/2021)  The ingredients appear to be similar to a lot of other products used in cosmetics.  Listing a few: Safflower oil - good for acne, eczema, and healthy skin; Silicone - helps product glide smoothly and easily; Squalane - an emollient and moisturizer, good for hydrating the skin; Chamomile (wild) - for the scent, not much.",1

This was my first time getting to try Mane Tame and I am officially a Fan! I would totally use this at the Salon and recommend this to Clients.<br />In the picture I used this on my Son. I applied it after spreading around and warming it up in my fingers on his dry hair. It stayed up really well and did not flake after you touched it to get rid of the stiffness. It added a lot of texture and had the perfect amount of shine. It helped make the cut more clean and had quite good strength in holding up his naturally curly, thick hair.

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B085SY4WC3,5,2021-01-27 05:07:25.464,Beautiful Glitters!,"These come together in a nice box that flips open at the top. There’s styrofoam at the top protecting the bottles. There’s an instruction booklet inside. There’s styrofoam holding each of the bottles in place inside, which I liked a lot! There’s stickers on the top of each colored polish. The stickers are the color of the polish and have numbers on them (like P037 and P038). I really liked they had stickers on the TOPS of the bottles so you can easily see which color the polish is. The bottles are all made of glass. They feel nice. And they are decent sizes.<br /><br />There are NO base or top coats included. This is ONLY colored polishes. So, if you don’t have a top and base coat, you’ll need to get your own to use this set.<br /><br />I got the chameleon shimmering color and black. Theres 6 polishes in total. There’s 5 glitter polishes - a lime green, a blue (the sticker is a little misleading, it makes it look like it’s a baby blue, but really it’s a royal blue), purple (again, the sticker is a little misleading, it looks like a pink, but the color is a purple), another purple, and a dark blue (again, the sticker is misleading, it looks like it’s a silver, but it’s a dark blue). There’s 1 solid color - a black.<br /><br />Even the photos on the product page can be a little misleading. On the product page the first photo shows a dark teal glitter, a dark blue glitter, a dark green glitter, a dark purple glitter, a blue glitter and then the solid black. But those are what the shades are supposed to look like with a black base. If you look at the other product photos, especially the 3rd one, you’ll see what the colors are without a black base and with a black base. All the shades look the same in the bottle as what’s shown in the 3rd product photo without a black base, EXCEPT “P041.” In the 3rd product photo “P041” without a black base looks like a silver glitter, just like the sticker on top of the bottle makes it seem. But, in the bottle and on the finger (without a black base), it looks like a dark blue glitter.<br /><br />These are glitters so they are a little thick, but they’re still easy to work with. They cure easily. They look beautiful with or without the black base. I love that I basically get 10 colors because I get 5 colors when I use a black base, and then 5 slightly different colors if I use the black base.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a cute set if you’re looking for glitter polishes!",1

There is a good variety of colors and some have glitter. I like this set because you get almost all the colors in a rainbow without breaking the bank and an added bonus, depending on how you look at it, is that they are small so you’re more likely to use it all instead of the polish just sitting there. The one thing for me was that the blue glitter polish was very sheer and I needed like 4 coats to build it up but the other colors worked great. I definitely like this little set.",1

First - the button placement is PERFECT!  Some headbands have the buttons way too high to use - these are set PERFECTLY.  I LOVE that  The colors are pretty nice too - especially for office wear! Not sure how often I will use the print ones - but the other colors are perfect for the office.  And when I am going out with my mask on - I never leave home without a mask headband.  It makes life so much easier and the mask more secure and much more comfortable.<br />The material is GREAT for making sure it does not slip off your head.  The velour makes sure it stays put and grips your hair and doesn't move.  The buttons are very pretty, stylish, and very much color coordinated with some of the headbands.  The only thing - because the buttons are 'so nice' and sort of concave - once you stick your mask on the button sort of sticks out a bit - more so than a flat button.  BUT with that being said - it grips your mask securely.  Some flat buttons let the mask slip off sort of easily.  AND it is just a button so who cares if it does not lie perfectly flat against your head. I mean I am already wearing a mask - so how picky can I really be.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the ""Helpful"" button.  Thanks! : )",1

The polygels in this kit are on the skinny side. I think these are definitely worth it on sale and would recommend you buy them then.,1

I will start from the beginning. This was the first time ever doing anything like this for me and my husband so we werent sure what to expect with the process. When you take these out I will caution you to watch how much you cute the parts that go on your feet as I cut my husband's too wide and some of the liquid that is inside did come out. So you know there is liquid inside each of the bags that go on your feet that feels weird on your feet and cold. We left on for the recommended time of an hour the process is explained in detail which I will give them kuddos for. Now after we let them stay on for an hour we then showered them off I placed lotion on my feet the first night again not sure what to expect and I didnt want this to dry my feet out too much as to where my husband didnt have a preference so he did not lotion his feet. He started seeing the peeling first. Now keep in mind I do get pedis and my last one was probably in March of 2020 and since then I have used a foot file and soak during that time. My peeling did not start until halfway thru the week so I thought that was important to mention. He does not get his feet done and never has. His peeling lasted about a week. We are about what a week and half in of peeling 2 weeks in since I did the foot mask my feet still look aweful and they are still peeling. I have started to apply lotion to the feet to see if this will help the process and only have seen minimal improvement. Now keep in mind I am an impatient person. Also to mention a burning and tingling sensation is expected its what we felt during the process once we were done. Overall I think I will stick to my parifan drips and doing my feet the way I have been doing I will say that it did wear down a few calluses I had on my feet its just the process I am not patient enough for I dont mind wearing socks too much but this is more of being forced to wear socks so I dont shed everywhere and even then I still find dead skin somewhere. This process was horrible to me and I think there are better ways to get these results. My husband didnt too much mind the process and his feet were in worse conditon than mind and his process didnt take as long and for me that was even more frustrating. This would not be something I would recommend unless you are a patient person and dont mind waiting like this for results I just want to let my feet breath again.<br /><br />Update: 2/2 My foot is still peeling this is def something I will not be doing again for me its about the fact that this is suppose to be something that takes time but really this amount of time for me is ridiculous and I can get the results its providing by using a foot file after soaking is that process more difficult yes but I get results within an hour not almost a month. My feet look nasty and dry even lotion isn't helping.,0

I usually don't use something like this during the day bc I try to keep my products to a minimum. For this reviews sake I used this during the day under my makeup and it looked good. Now I use this at night. We expose our skin to alot of stresses in the environment and at night our skin rejuvenates. So I feel this is great to use while I sleep. This jar may seem small but a little goes a long way so it should last some time. It's not greasy, spreads across my face easily, and it absorbs well. It's very hydrating and it doesn't leave a shine on your face. I do use this sometimes during the day if I'm not wearing any makeup. (Like I said it looked good under makeup, I just don't use a separate moisturizer on makeup days I use a few other products and it'd be too much) Anyway when I wake up in the morning my skin really feels good. It's soft, smooth, and supple. It even has a bit more bounce back of you know what I mean. I'm impressed with this cream. It's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin which can be mildly sensitive. So I definitely can say I recommend it.",1

Clear (no acne, minimal lines) but with type 1 Rosacea (redness & visible veins/telangiectasias).<br /><br />My typical routine:<br />morning: wash face, apply hydrating toner (sometimes use 7 skins method), serum, moisturizer, SPF (I ALWAYS use SPF, that is my #1 skin care product)<br />night: double cleanse (1st oil based wash, then water based wash), hydrating toner (often 7 skins method), serum/actives, moisturizer and/or moisturizing overnight ""mask"" or occlusive.",1
AG7JCEMC64AM7JPATDVGP6YZOTXA,B07W1WJZFG,3,2021-01-30 17:38:49.379,"Unscented, Seems Decent, Not 100% Sure About Ingredients","I looked up the ingredients for this product at the Environmental Working Groups (EWG) Skin Deep data base & the following ingredients either rated as not green or I couldn't find them (0=green or safe, 10=red or dangerous):<br /><br />CYCLOPENTASILOXANE (3) - Persistent, bioaccumulative in wildlife, classified as expected to be toxic or harmful, uterine tumors in female rats, increased anogenital distance observed in rats at a moderate dose, moderate dose in rate suggested dopamine D2-receptor behavior on pituitary cells, suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative.<br />POLYSORBATE-60 (3)<br />DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br />ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN - Can't find this ingredient on EWG.<br /><br />I looked up DIPEPTIDE-3 AMINOHEXANOATE on DuckDuckGo & I guess it's a new skin ingredient. It might be why it & ACETYL ETHYLHEXYLGLYCERIN are not on EWG as they haven't been evaluated for safety. I really don't know though, it's just speculation on my part. As for safety, who knows? I rely on EWG to let me know. This is frustrating.<br /><br />I've used this several evenings as a night cream & I like it, but I don't love it. I heat my home exclusively with a wood stove. Even running humidifiers & essential oil diffusers 24/7, the air is painfully dry. So far this cream seems pretty good on my middle aged skin. The funny thing is, out of all the various brands I've tried on my face, a little known handmade brand has by far served me best. It's a brand called Eruzile or Progress in Health. They have two names. I don't know why. It's really annoying. They are on Etsy & last I checked, have their own website but for some foolish reason, it seems to be more expensive to shop at their website. And to be clear, I am not affiliated with them, I'm just a long time customer. Another brand I like but it is ridiculously expensive, so I hardly ever buy it is Juice Beauty Stem Cellular. You can get it right here on amazon.<br /><br />Okay, back to this brand. It is a light/thin feeling cream. Not greasy. It seems to absorb well. My skin does feel a tiny bit tight when I get up in the morning. I find a few spritz with rose water helps. This is packaged in a glass pot that you use your fingers to apply. A little plastic in the lid, so not Zero Waste, but not bad. It is not scented. It does have a smell as is normal because the ingredients will have their own smell to them, but when applying I don't notice the smell, so calling it unscented or fragrance free is more than reasonable. I only notice its smell if I'm practically sticking my nose in the pot & inhaling deeply.<br /><br />For me, this isn't moisturizing enough for the dead of winter, but for spring & fall I expect it will serve me fine.<br /><br />Overall, I would have rated this higher if not for the ingredient concerns.",0

AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,B08N9RT9YD,4,2021-01-31 00:52:07.215,"Softest soft, not for exfoliating",I have been using a loofah but I feel like I wanted something that could easily reach my entire back without having to be a total contortionist in the shower. A brush with handle seemed like the obvious choice.<br /><br />The first one I bought had bristles on it and it was so hard it hurt to use so I couldn’t even bear the discomfort on my back. That one was better for scrubbing feet or less sensitive areas.<br /><br />This one is completely different and luxurious. The handle is a thick bamboo that is sealed. It’s a neutral colored wood but very attractive. There is some wrapped smooth rope on the base of the brush for holding. It makes the brush less slick when it’s wet and soapy. There is also a hole with a piece of that same rope for hanging. I use the rope to hang the body brush off of my shower caddy.<br /><br />The bristles are extremely soft! They are pure white and have been cut so that they have a texture for the skin.  The bristles are tightly positioned and there are a ton of tiny ones. They are as soft it not softer than some of my smoothest make up brushes. It’s soft enough that it could be used on my skin without irritating it.<br /><br />Now the flip side is that because it is so soft there isn’t any exfoliating action. I wouldn’t mind some slightly more rigid like a loofah for really deep cleaning. It’s even softer than a wash cloth but closer to a makeup cloth. This brush is really going to depend on the user and the need. It’s not for exfoliating.,1

That seem to be firm but the bristles can be super hard and painful, really hard to find one that is soft.<br /><br />This one is the opposite. The handle is quite long about 16’. It easily reaches to the middle of my back and easily hits any spots I need to get with a tad bit of stretching. The brush head is super soft, almost angelic. I’m surprised the bristles was made of nylon, the texture reminds me of a soft and durable cotton. When wet, the brush acts as a gentle exfoliating sponge. With small nodules making slight caresses across your skin, getting it clean with little effort needed at all.<br /><br />It doesn’t hurt at all, if anything it gives the sensation of a gentle massage and a polisher for your skin. Very soothing and really makes your skin shine in the best way possible. My skin didn’t feel sore, worn or even stung after using this. It looked and felt very bright, relaxed and soothed.<br /><br />Definitely the best shower I had in a minute without having to rely on a loufa for any exfoliation.<br /><br />After all of it, it even has a string so it can be hung up anywhere you like either in your bedroom or bathroom. Very convenient storage and dries quite fast and easily as well.<br /><br />Either way, out of all the brushes I have tried this takes the cake as the most handiest and softest of them all. Everyone should have one, your skin would thank you for the extra TLC.<br /><br />I even included a picture of it when wet, it clumps making it better for scrubbing<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.

Inside, the pencil is wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />The pencil is a standard jumbo kind of pencil and has a clear lid. I show a photo comparing it to a pen to show size.<br /><br />I got the shade “Chalfont - 303,” which is described as a “shimmering shade of Pearl.” For me, this just wasn’t great. For me, I just think it’s definitely not worth $18 (at the time of writing this review).<br /><br />The product info page describes the pencil as having “intense colour.” I did not notice any intensity of color! It says, “Use your makeup highlighter pencil as a creamy, velvety eyeshadow, eyeliner, and highlighter. Apply it to your inner corners and entire eyelid for a pop of intense colour.” This pencil wasn’t creamy or velvety. To me it felt really dry and was even kind of powdery on application. It also says, “It can be used on its own with a beautiful opaque colour payoff, or built up for extra glamour thanks to its vibrant pigment.” It didn’t seem opaque at all. It could be because I got a shimmer Pearl shade. But, when I applied it, you could hardly see it, I had to really layer it, and even then it’s just not very noticeable.<br /><br />I’ve tried other Pippa of London products and they’ve been great. Unfortunately, this pencil wasn’t one of them. This was a no for me. It could have been the color, maybe if I would have gotten a darker color it would have performed as the product page describes.

It’s not a big deal because it’s so small, but it would be nice if the mirror would have come better protected so that it wasn’t missing a piece no matter how small.<br /><br />Second, this doesn’t really hold much unless you want it to be all separate parts. If you have it all put together with the side trays sitting on each side of the big oval tray, the silicone pieces over top the side trays, and the square tray sitting in the middle of the big oval tray - Then you can’t hold much with it. The side trays with the silicone pieces only hold so much. The one with the lines you can lay brushes in the grooves like shown in the photos on the product page. But, there’s only 4 grooves where brushes can actually lay, and more than 1 or sometimes 2 brushes is all that fits in each groove. The other silicone tray has the X’s that you can put things in so they stand straight up. There’s 11 small ones and 8 big ones. The big ones you could potentially fit more than 1 item in. Also, the middle tray part that the mirror goes over as a lid, if you’re going to do that, then you can only have items in that tray that the mirror will be able to lay flat over, so that limits how much and what you can place in it. If you have it all put together, then it doesn’t take up much room. But, if you have it all in separate parts (like the first photo on the product page), then it takes up a lot of room for not holding too much. I might as well keep using my cups or brush holders for my brushes, which hold a ton of brushes, and plastic or acrylic drawer organizers.<br /><br />Third, I don’t like how the mirror just sits, it isn’t actually attached. It comes off so easy. One little bump and the mirror falls over. It would be nice if they would have that attached somehow so that it would fold down over the tray but still be connected.<br /><br />Finally, it’s supposed to be easy to wash and dry. To me, the silicone pieces are not easy to clean. The dust collects on them like crazy. And I try to just wipe off the dust with a dry cloth but the silicone is rubbery and the dust just kind of sticks to it. If you use a wet cloth you’re able to get the dust, but you have to work really hard to get it off. I just don’t like it.<br /><br />Overall, this just doesn’t work for me. I wanted it to organize things while taking up less space. But, when it is taking up less space, it doesn’t hold enough for me. If you’re looking just to hold a few small things. Like you have some small items that you just want to have a place, then this might work for you. As long as you don’t mind that the mirror isn’t attached and might come off easy.",0

(I once had an Essie polish like this called Ballet Slippers, which this is similar to.)

I have ordered glass bottles in the past and while the bottles themselves were always okay, the sprayer was often inferior (plus they usually don’t have the other components such as labels, funnel, marking pen, caps).  The glass bottles are great, gorgeous color and sturdy glass.  Colored bottles are needed for certain liquids (peroxide, for example, always comes in an amber/brown container to protect it from light).  The sprayer is high quality and is sturdy.  The spray action is also great - you can set it on mist or stream.  As I noted, the sprayer has been my downfall on previous bottle purchases, so I am happy to see that the sprayers on these are top notch.  You also get two screw on caps in case you don’t want to use the sprayer (or need to transport them and are concerned about leakage).  It also includes 4 labels and a white marking pen, as well as a small stainless steel funnel.  Every component included in the set is top notch, and the totality of the package makes it an excellent value.  I will also note that the bottles and components were very well packaged to protect them during the shipping process.  Overall a definite winner.  Hope this review is helpful to you!",1

There’s a nice sized pink nail file. There’s a dual headed tool - one end has the flat metal side to apply the poly gel. The other side is a brush. There’s a bottle of base coat and a bottle of top coat. There’s also a bag of dual forms.<br /><br />This has everything you need EXCEPT for slip solution, which you can just use alcohol so that’s not a huge deal. The product info page says, “you can use alcohol ,cleanser or base coat to instead, They act the same effect.).” Also, one of the photos on the product page says, “Base coat could be used as a slip solution. It will make it easier to make gel smoothly. No alcohol or nail cleanser needed!” I’ve never heard of using cleanser (what cleanser do they mean? 🤷‍♀️) or base coat as a slip solution. But I’m pretty new to poly gels, so I could just not know. Unless it’s just this brands base coat that can be used as a slip solution? 🤷‍♀️<br /><br />There’s a good assortment of colors. You get “clear,” “nude,” “pink,” “orange red,” “bean paste” (I’m not sure why the product info page calls it that but it’s like a pinky mauve type color to me), “brown” (this is like a light tan color), and 2 “color changing” (one looks like it goes from a hot pink or purplish pink to white and the other looks like it goes from a pinky red to a white).<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great set.

The two sided different type of scrubber on each side gives you an option as to how you want to feel it on your back. It has a convenient length and two handles that is good for those who can’t lift their arms to use the single wooden handle back scrubber.<br /><br />However, this is my problem.  I am so used to the loofah exfoliators wherein it is scratchy and makes my back feel really clean. This one, though it makes a good feeling when you use either type of the scrub on either side, still does not have that full satisfaction that you’ve cleaned your back well. It is too soft for me. It needs some more toughness on the bristles or a little rigidity on the bumps so you can feel it better. The length is awesome as I have problems with my rotator cuff and painful to lift up my arms. A little more add to the length will probably be helpful.<br /><br />As a note, make sure that you soak this at least every 2-3 uses in probably a vinegar solution to disinfect or efficiently clean as unnoticeable grime builds up on the surface and you won’t even notice it.",0

Lately, I noticed that the skin on my back was breaking out.  Fortunately, I began using the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.  It doesn't have sharp bristles that scratch and irritate my skin.  The brush feels as though it has plush fur from a plush animal.  It is very soft, almost too soft.  It feels great when I use it on the bottoms of my bare feet.  This brush, I believe is for elderly people or those with very sensitive skin.  It has a long, durable string for easy hanging in the bath or shower.<br /><br />Despite it not being very exfoliating, the skin on my lower back has cleared up quite a bit.  I've been using this brush faithfully for two weeks.  It is lightweight, manufactured well, and attractive.  I like the bamboo handle, which is smooth and easy to grip.  It doesn't put splinters into my fingers and palms.  I can use this brush all over my body, but I use it primarily on my back and feet.  It arrived inside its own plastic, transparent box for protection and for easy gift wrapping in case you want to give it to someone as a present.  The box can also be used for storing the brush.<br /><br />The brush's head is very easy to clean after it has been used.  I have used both bar soap and liquid soap on the head.  The brush works well with many types of soap.  When using this brush, I always feel as though I am treating myself to a luxurious bath.  I highly recommend this Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush to anyone who has delicate skin.  If you are looking for a type of brush that will exfoliate your skin (sloughing off all those dead skin cells), then you may want to look for another brush.  For right now, I am very satisfied with the Zhaoyun Bath Body Brush.",1

Everything needed from start to finish for little nails is included.<br /><br />There are two cubed nail files and buffers with the frozen nature, Anna, and Elsa printed on them. The nail polishes are very Arendelle<br />colors. Blue, purple, green, yellow, and orange are the main color themes in the set. They are natural and remind us of the elements; trees, water, ice, etc. There is a nail dryer that is in the shade of purple with an Elsa and Ana sticker on the front. It’s a petite size and perfect for little princess hands. I like that the battery case is enclosed with two tiny screws. They are safe and the children are unable to get to them. After the nails have been dried there are various gemstones and stickers that can be used. They are a small size and work for toddler and up. The gemstones are a little bit bigger and a little large on my toddler‘s fingers.  However the size is ideal for a child’s finger nails.<br /><br />My daughter has had so much fun with this kit. There are a ton of options for color. Naturally with so much to choose from, she never wants any one fingernail painted the same.<br /><br />The bottles have all been easy to open and use. They each have a different color as well as a different sticker for the handle of the nail polish. Again, everything is Frozen theme so it’s a huge draw for my little Frozen lover.<br /><br />Also this is a completely gift-able set.

It looks like your typical false lash. I apply my eye makeup, then my regular liner. After that I use the special magnetic liner along the lash line, over top my regular liner exactly where I want the magnetic lashes to adhere. I only wait a few minutes before the magnetic liner is dry, then I apply the lashes and they stick like MAGIC! I love how these stay in place all day but also the fact that I can actually take these off and readjust as the day goes on. Be sure to wait until the magnetic liner is dry or you will end up with liner stuck to the lashes rather than your eye. I love that I can wash these and reuse them. Removal is simple, you just peel off the lashes WITHOUT any pain what so ever. The magnetic liner is fairly easy to get off with soap and water or an oil based makeup remover.

They're difficult to photograph, but in the light in person, they're quite pretty. Several of the colors are jellies, but I still think you could get full coverage from them (the dark red particularly would be a beautiful, deep red). Pictured are all of the colors in two coats, but on the nails you might need three, as when holding the swatch dots up you could still see through them. They do all cure within 60 seconds. I do also like that the bottles look different than my other gel polishes do, but are still the same size / shape so they still easily fit in with the others in my storage boxes.",1

AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,B08LZ6W8RF,4,2021-02-11 08:22:49.631,Nice Little Open Storage- Not What I Would Choose For Traveling,"This CONBOLA Make Up Organizer is pretty handy for organizing small makeup items. I ordered the white and grey, and it looks quite nice. I would say it looks just like the pictures.<br /><br />The grey is a sturdy and durable plastic. The white inserts are a nice, thick, and flexible silicone. It will separate into 7 different pieces which is convenient and also makes everything easy to clean. You can use it all together or individual pieces separately.<br /><br />The mirror is fine and you insert into place and remove by pulling back out. I do think they missed an opportunity to have this on a detachable hinge or something.<br /><br />I think my favorite part of this product is the silicone insert that you can insert various makeup pencils, brushes, etc in standing up. Most of my brushes don’t fit as well into the bigger sized slots, but it still works.<br /><br />This is cute overall, but I think the biggest improvement that could be made to this other than a hinged mirror would be to make this deeper. As you can see in my picture, there is a standard sized setting powder sitting in the main compartment. It fits there, but not if you wanted to put the mirror/lid down to cover it.<br /><br />Basically this is a cute open storage. Most off the products I have pictured would not fit in this for any type of closed storage. I think the company could make this design into and awesome display/storage case that fully closes with a handle for traveling or something- but it would have to be much deeper.<br /><br />I don’t think this is something I would want to take traveling, because I would have to take everything out and put in a bag or something before also packing this up and that defeats the purpose of it for traveling in my opinion. Some people may like to have this to display and openly store all their items when traveling though, but it just wouldn’t be my first choice since you can’t pack everything inside it when it is time to go.<br /><br />Anyway, this is still a nice little product if you think the size and function will suit your needs. I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so, I would love to know- thanks!",1

I recently started wearing makeup again, (and now have stopped, because...masks!), and since my eyes are all anyone sees all day, I thought these might look nice. This review is of: Magnetic eyelashes with eyeliner，Beevila False Eyelashes Upgraded 5D Magnetic Eyeliner and Eyelashes Kit, fake eyelashes 5 Pairs with Tweezers, Easy to Wear,No glue!.<br /><br />As I said above, I'm a newbie at these. I have had no other experience with them, so take my opinion with a grain of salt! I played around with these twice. The first time, I couldn't stand how they felt at the outer edges of my eyes. The liner was easy to put on, but the lashes themselves? Not so much. I was finally able to reposition them to where my eyes felt comfortable. They made a BIG difference in how my eyes looked-so much so that it surprised me.  The second time I tried them, things went a bit more smoothly and definitely faster. They looked great, but again I had to adjust them a little bit because my eye lid was getting irritated.<br /><br />Not gonna lie, the problems I had with these were most likely MY problems and not the fault of the lashes. Since I've not tried the glue on type before, I have nothing to compare these to. As I get more proficient with them, (I will keep trying because I love the look!), I'm hoping that the process will become even easier and I can make these a part of my daily routine.",1

It works best with more than 1 coating, but does a decent job of getting the tiny lashes coated, covers things pretty well, has a few clumps (but they're pretty minimal), and stays on well (thank you, waterproofing).

I love the scent -- it's a light, ""fresh"" scent that is sort of floral and sort of botanical. Normally I prefer unscented (or something that just smells soapy) but this light scent is quite enjoyable. It's a thick cream that resembles a moisturizer more so than a soap.<br /><br />There's virtually no lather to it. It foams up a bit, but very lightly. It's a very gentle soap but, for me, it's a bit too gentle in that I don't have a clean feeling after using it. My face feels more like I've applied a moisturizer. That's not a bad thing, especially in the dry winter months, but I want to have a clean-feeling face after using a face soap, and I don't get it from this.<br /><br />Balancing the positive and negative features puts my rating at three stars (average). It smell great and it is very gentle, but it's not a face soap I'd get again. There are other gentle soaps that also offer better cleaning and a better value on a cost per ounce basis.",0
AHGQDSOBAIVAAKJFIVEGS344MSXA,B08MT8L5ZL,5,2021-02-13 22:57:57.706,A Cadillac compare to my other light,"This light is large, powerful, and easy to use. It has a long enough cord to reach any outlet that I need to. I like that it also has an option to charge my phone. It is all one piece so no worry about parts falling off when you lift it. However, the base can be removed if you choose.<br /><br />The timers include the standard 30 and 60 seconds as well as a 10 second option. There is a smart sensor option also.",1
AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,B08MT8L5ZL,5,2021-02-14 01:17:49.654,Very nice design/form. Easy base top connection. Provides USB ports.,"This is a surprising UV curing lamp. It has a minor elaboration of the conventional design, allowing for a slightly wider opening, but still having a multi=angle lamp placement. 72 Watts is not the most powerful UV rating for this gel curing/drying lamp, but is more than ample power to do the job in reasonably quick time.<br />That said, I believe that this UV lamp actually normally will output 36W, unless you specifically activate the ""Double Power"" setting. To do this, you select one of the 3 'regular' timers: 10S, 30S or 60S (S = seconds). This sets the timing for the lamp operation. If you then press the last button, which is also the 99S ""Lowe Heat Mode"" button, and hold for about 3 seconds, it will activate the lamp into 72W...double the power. Thus the regular default UV setting is 36W.  If you press the 99S button, the UV power will gradually increase over the 99 seconds.<br />The device also has a sensor to turn the system on/off depending if it senses hand/foot in the cavity. If you need more time, just hit one of the timer buttons again.<br />There is no power on/off button. Once you plug the power adapter in, the unit is 'on' and ready to go, once you set timer and insert your fingers.<br />While the opening is wider than most other UV lamps, it's still a tight fit for both hands. But, I appreciate the slight elaboration of the cavity opening.<br />One new design element that I truly appreciate is the method to connect the top and base. There are small posts with magnets atop them. These magnetically attach to corresponding screws in recessed holes. So, it takes minimal effort to separate them, but easily hold together. Other lamps have a tab in slot method that sometimes is difficult to unlock or match up easily to attach. This improvement is a smart innovative upgrade.<br />Another innovation is the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports, located about the power plug port. Both of these USB ports are rated at only 5V 2A. So check the usb specs of any device you connect to these USB charging ports. But, it's a nice addition, anyway. It is a handy port to connect a nail dust fan, or nail drill.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images, with close-ups to highlight features.<br />On my wish list is a separate power on/off button, and while the display is view-oriented for the person inserting fingers, it would make sense to have the timer buttons oriented in the same manner. I think most people purchasing these lamps are DIY nail artists. It's not too difficult to manage the timer buttons, but it would just be simpler and common sense to have these controls positioned for easy operation by the user. These issues apply to all the UV lamps that I've encountered. It's a personal perspective/opinion, and does not affect the ratings of this device.<br />So, this UV curing lamp is default 36W, with the capability of user option to double power to 72W. It has a nice design and improved magnetic connection for top and base.  it's a very capable and competent device.<br />Accordingly, it earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1

They’re on there really well so you don’t have to worry about them falling off easily. And I’ve gotten so many compliments on it because it is just so different than your typical headband. The best part is that there are so many colors in the jewels that it will go with many different outfits. I can’t say enough good things about this headband.",1

They're only 5 mL, but you do get a lot of options so I think the price is still fair. Depending on your preference, you'll probably want 2-3 coats of each color; they're all pictured in 2, and do cure in 60 seconds. There are colored stickers already on the top of each bottle, but I don't feel they accurately show the colors inside, so I still added swatch dots.<br />The black velvet box does rub off on the white top / base coat bottles, but that's okay. One of these white bottles also had some color on it making me wonder if I possibly got a set that was returned, but I honestly like the color selection far too much to take off a star even for this.",1

I don't think the people who took care of her were nice or gentle with her in any way.  Poor little thing is only 4.5 pounds and she's fairly old and toothless so it's not like she'd turn and bite anyone trying to keep her looking like the pretty little girl she is.  I got this brush for her fine, curly hair.  She is a sweet little girl, but will ""bleat"" if she thinks you intend to hurt her and the first time I put a brush to her, she was shivering like I was going to do something bad to her.  I talked to her and took my time and by the time I was done, she was relaxed and let me work on her a little at a time.  My other furgirl is an older, rescued papillion and because her fur is straight with no undercoat, this brush works great on her.  She doesn't mind the brush at all and I think she likes how it lightly ""scratches"" her skin at the same time. Great brush for my two old girls!",1

It comes with a cable already to plug into any outlet but I guess if you wanted to use your own cord you could. I ended up plugging my nail drill/file into the back of the unit so I didn't have multiple things to plug into separate outlets. The lights go around the entire inside of the dome so you don't have to worry about your hand being flat. It has 3 different settings on the top for 30/60/90 seconds. I just watched the timer on the top of the unit that counts up every time you put your hand or foot in. I like that the entire unit is plastic and not metal.

It has a pearlized finish with some elegant swirls at the top, but it really just looks like a plastic vanity mirror that should come with one of the Barbie mannequin heads that little girls put makeup on and do their hair.<br />The mirror has three light settings, bright white, really yellow, and I'm assuming a daylight, which is the only light I can somewhat see myself a little bit with it on. Really, it's just awful trying to see in this mirror with the light on. This is the first lighted mirror that I've experienced this with. For some reason, the light seems to shadow your face somehow, or either it's just the wrong color or brightness, and you can hardly see yourself in the mirror at all. And, no matter which mirror I want to look in, I have to pick the mirror up and bring it close to my face. And even then, I feel like I'm looking at light, and not my face being brightened by the light.<br />Also, once put together, the fold out mirrors do not stay flush when folded in. It gives it the look like you've broken it and are just living with it like that. And, I find the fold out mirrors very cumbersome to look at myself in them, with the light on or off. Especially the bottom one that has the most magnification, which really should have been on the top, in my opinion. If I don't pick it up, I have to bend way down to see in the bottom one, and then I can only see half of my face if the light is on. The other half is in a shadow, whether the light is on or off. The upper mirror is just as hard to see in, as my face is shadowed on one side very heavily if the light is on. It's just an awkward design.<br />This mirror seemed somewhat good in theory, but because of the very poor design and the lack of quality materials, it is rendered nearly useless. Each mirror, in and of itself, is nice and clear and seems great. One might think of recycling them, or a young girl may find better use of this vanity mirror as she's playing dress up, or learning to do makeup. For myself, because I cannot see into it with the lights on, as it's meant to be used, and I don't find it aesthetically pleasing to display, I will not be using it.",0

I liked the idea of this brush, but the actual product really wasn't all that. First of all, this thing is much larger than any other slicker style brush I have. This is a great feature for my large dog, but it was just ridiculous trying to groom my cats with this large, unyielding wire brush. So, not a good choice for the cats.<br /><br />Unfortunately, not a good choice for my dog either, as she has a short coat with little to no undercoat and she was really uncomfortable with wires dragging on her skin. She's more of a rubber curry comb type gal, I guess. Besides the size and wire bristle problems, the plastic itself felt a little brittle and cheap and when you add in the mechanics of retractable bristles... I think higher quality material would have been a better choice because that slider for the bristles is very basic. Finally, while I loved the idea of the easy-to-clean retractable bristles, they really aren't necessary and if those wires become crooked or bent it will cause all kinds of problems with the retraction. I've made it decades by just pulling the fur out of my slicker brushes-- it literally takes 2-3 seconds-- and while the thought of retractable bristles is nice, it totally isn't necessary.

The key however to applying them is to make sure you have a quality magnetic liner for application, and patience.<br /><br />I'm not huge on wearing false eyelashes or makeup on a regular basis, however for things such as family photos and an occasional date night out, it can be fun to get dressed up and feel a little ""extra"".<br /><br />The lashes themselves are really good quality, the liquid eyeliner goes on pretty well, but my only beef is that it can be sometimes difficult to get the magnet part to stick. But once it does, they look fairly natural.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend people to give these a try. They are priced well for having 6 pairs, can be reused, and the set contains everything you need to try them out. Overall, recommended.",1

I have so many other things plugged into my outlets.  This is just one less.  There are two fold out mirrors - one on top on the left side and one on the bottom on the right side.  They have different levels of magnification.  Those would be a little better if they were a little larger.  The middle mirror is the perfect size though.  This stands up on a base.

This Murad Hydration Intense Recovery Cream is pale green and has a nice, light spearmint scent that may be from mint oils, such as Mentha Viridis Leaf Oil and Mentha Arvensis Leaf Oil, as chemical fragrance isn’t listed. This cream has an unusual balmy texture that feels slippery and silky. It oddly feels like it just sits on top of my dry skin rather being absorbed. It’s not greasy, but it feels heavy like a barrier cream. I’m not crazy about that feel. I do like that it’s thick and has somewhat of a firming feel.<br /><br />I’d be okay with the texture at night (not for daytime), but this cream imparts a strong cooling sensation (possibly from mint oil as this is alcohol free) that doesn’t feel pleasing to me. Instead of feeling soothing and calming, it feels stimulating and kind of agitating. My skin gets itchy and prickly, so I’ve had to wash it off as my skin feels uncomfortable and like it might blister or get a rash (though it hasn’t in the short time I’ve left it on). It feels better rubbed on my arm, so maybe it’s good for other skin types.<br /><br />I can’t gauge how well this hydrates as I had to discontinue use. It has some good stuff like apple fruit extract (scavenges free radicals) and algae (antioxidant and hydration). It also has moisturizing and/or soothing ingredients, such as glycerin, vitamin E, butylene glycol, macadamia nut oil and shea butter. However, it also has known sensitizers, such as spearmint and mint oils, that get “poor” ratings by Paula’s Choice. This generally seems like a quality cream, but it feels heavy and irritating to my sensitive skin. 3.5 stars.",0

The stickers looks absolutely beautiful, a first glance I fell in love. The designs and the colors were great; the colors have an iridescent quality in addition to the wide range of colors, it really adds another layer.'<br /><br />Now, what disappointed me. These don't stick, like at all. There is a small amount of stickiness that lasts for mere seconds before these things fall off their surface (I've tried plastic, acrylic, skin, hardwood, and even carpeting to see). Honestly I was pretty surprised that these didn't stick to my carpet fibers. You can see in my photo that  I used these for nail art, and the lifting is visible. I held the stickers down when I noticed them lifting from the nail, but after a 30 seconds of holding the sticker down (onto a top coat, too) the gorgeous little butterflies lifted anyway.<br /><br />I want to give this product more stars so badly. The three stars I have given are for the aesthetics alone, while the other two stars are missing because the product does not really work the way it is intended to. I would recommend buying these as long as you are aware that you're going to need another product to make these stick to whatever surface you are using, and that lifting of the sticker away from the surface can happen.",0

I love that this is portable and take up little space. The colors are a good mix, although I'd be happier with one of the pinks substituted for something more exciting. Overall great color choices.<br /><br />The brush is excellent, no fibers fell off and the brush was soft and cleaned the nail powder from the nails without marring the nail surface. The little side set of a cuticle pusher and nail files was nice, I really enjoyed the addition of a cuticle trimmer.<br /><br />The powders are absolutely amazing. These are the first powders I've ever used that came out perfect, nail after nail. It was extremely easy, and the powder so smoothly covered the nail that I didn't even need to buff them before top coat. They were just smooth, I've never had that happen with dip powders before. The color is also nice and vibrant, you don't need more than 3 dips (I wanted a nice, solid pink) to achieve your look. The addition of the brush saver (step 4) was a lifesaver, I feel it's a must have for doing dip nails.<br /><br />I didn't like the top coat at all. It didn't spread well, felt stiff, didn't give a good shine... it didn't make sense as the rest of the kit was pretty great. I'd use another top coat next time. Also, the pots of powder are kind of small to dip your nails in, but I made it work. I'd definitely purchase the powders again, I would love to see a powder and brush saver set! I can give or take the activator and base coat, but don't recommend the top coat. Great starter dip set.",1

I use the pink on my friend hair and she has commented that her hair washed is less rough. And on inspection the scalp is as clean as if I did it with my fingers.

AE3KLVXGZPANXE5XLXYKHTVAZ3FQ,B01N7A5AGF,4,2021-02-21 14:31:33.005,Pretty decent product but do your research,"Overall, this product isn’t horrible compared to others on the market. It is paraben-free, sulfate-free, EU Allergen free and uses minimal ingredients however it also contains alcohol, silicone and is not safe for fungal acne.  After running this product through a cosmetic ingredient safety checker, it scored an 88% one the EWG Health Rating.  Most popular, name-brand face lotions are around 65%-80% on the EWG Health Rating. I use the EWG (Environment Working Group) as a reference when checking products and try to stay away from the alarmist side. Only 8% of this product is considered “moderate risk” mainly polyarylamide, Fragrance (unnecessary additive; possible allergy) , alcohol denat. (Bad for dry skin, bad for sensitive skin, potentially block pores) and BHT (also found in edibles, rubber products and is banned in UK and EU due to limited research showing BHT is linked to cancer). This product is good for brightening, anti-aging and promotes wound healing.  It also contains steric acid which can potentially block pores.<br /><br />Keep in mind, everyone’s skin is different and what effects one person may not effect another. Learn your skin and what products work best for you. Personally, I would stay away from this product if you have very dry skin and/or sensitive skin. I have “normal” skin (no sensitivities, not overly dry or oily, limited acne, no allergies) and didn’t have any issues with this product so far. It has a light scent that isn’t overpowering but completely unnecessary (I HATE fragrance in beauty products; stick with essential oils). It absorbed nicely and didn’t leave my face feeling oily. I am giving this product 4 stars as of February 21, 2021 due to the minimal ingredients and will update this review once a larger amount of time has passed to fully understand how to works with my skin.",1

So, actually all 6 are attractive and usable, but she was especially fond of the other 5. haha.<br />Attached are photos to show the unboxing, and images of the product. Also a close-up of the gel polish that was being used today.<br />The gel polish is rich and somewhat thick. The significant other said it's really good. That she can use a thin layer and get good coverage. The bottles are numbered, but wouldn't it be smart to put a dot with the actual color of the enclosed gel polish on the bottle top? She agreed, and shrugged her shoulders. Since this seems like an industry standard, of not identifying the colors with...color, the lack thereof does not ding the rating.<br />These seem to be quality gel polishes.

I’ve also tried it with other sets of base and top coats and it works fine with those too. The sets lasted a few weeks no problems. The only thing that I’m not a fan of, is the colors. It supposed to be the color that it is on the tube. I find that the colors look a bit different from the tube to the dot that I made on the stick, and then even bigger difference on my nails. For instance, the red tube. Looks like a lighter red on the dot. Then on my hands, it turned red orange(not color changing either). I didn’t finish with a top coat before I took a picture because I didn’t like the color at all and I ended up painting it over with gel nail polish. Really that’s the only on with such a big difference. The others are not a big difference but a bit more sheer than I expected. It is still good quality, so if you like the colors then this set is for you. A bit on the expensive side for the amount of poly gels you get, and I’m not a big fan of the colors so I wouldn’t reorder this.",1

As if that wasn't enough, the seller also hand made an orgami heart out of a post-it note!!! Just a little touch that tells me they have a great business ethic and that they want you happy!!! And happy I am! (in best Yoda voice)<br />I get tired of leaving less than perfect feedback. So many items these days I have to leave at 1 star or 3 stars, and its nice to receive an item thats a full 5 stars without any doubt!!!<br />Don't think about it, just buy it.

AHPGHDFIU3BUB3RQBP56RQQA7W4Q,B08GKVYS1Y,5,2021-02-23 04:34:29.460,Excellent quality. Very attractive assortment of confetti and glitter polishes. Small bottles.,"This is an excellent assortment of attractive, quality gel polish, with base coat and top coat (no wipe and matte versions). The presentation elevates the worth as a gifting option.  One of the best features of this set is the bottles of gel polish provide actual representations of the contents. On the top of the cap is a sticker with proper identification of the color (including glitter, confetti varieties). Also on the front label is a small circle, under the brand name, that has an accurate portrayal of the contents. Finally, a company gets it. So, this boosts the rating a bit.<br />There are 16 varieties of gel polish, with confetti and glitter. The consistency is perfect, allowing application of a thin coat. An ability to apply a thin coat is essential, mainly due to the size of these bottles. They are 5ml (0.17fl oz), which is one of the smallest bottles of gel polish that i've encountered. This is actually a disappointing size/quantity of gel polish. Based on the size of the bottles of gel polish, I consider this to actually be a sampler set, as opposed to a set of 'normal' sized bottles of attractive confetti, glitter gel polishes. So, i guess one can try out the various polishes and then purchase larger bottles of desired varieties.<br />Overall, I feel all of the polishes in the assortment are visually attractive. The polishes are excellent quality, and produce excellent results. The significant other tested the gel on some fake nails, and i commented that it looks beautiful as is...no need to add any embellishments/decorations. She agreed., but said she'd combinde solid color gel polish with these, and add some rhinestones or other decorations, maybe create a marbled effect. I could see her creative juices flowing.<br />The product does match the descriptions and pictures in the product details. The presentation is effective and top notch. We like the quality and consistency of the gel polishes and base/top coats.  If the bottles were at least the size of the base/top coat bottles, this set would be perfect and worth 5 stars. As currently configured, based on observations and impressions, this quality 'sampler' set earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1
AGPTRM72WHO5EUPQUWS47FFGAALA,B08SQZ1B3W,5,2021-02-23 16:56:49.335,High quality skincare for my aged skin,"I became a fan of the Murad brand after receiving different Murad products in my beauty box subscriptions over the past few years. The products I received in the past were high quality and, I feel, superior to other brands that I have tried with similar claims. This intense recovery cream does not disappoint.<br /><br />The thick & luxurious cream comes in a 1.7 ounce frosted glass tub and it is easily applied to my face & neck area. It has a very slight hygienic scent that quickly dissipates after application. The product immediately absorbed & left my skin feeling soothed & hydrated and never tacky or greasy. I have very sensitive skin and the cream caused my face no adverse reactions.<br /><br />Directions indicate to apply it to clean face, neck & chest morning and night. I use a variety of skincare serums depending on the time of day & the current condition of my skin and this cream played nicely with my other skin care products and make-up.<br /><br />Murad claims, ""Now, calm comes in a cream. Murad's Intense Recovery Cream is a clinically proven, comforting cream for face & eyes that reduces visible signs of stress-induced aging and redness. Microalgae extract smooths the look of facial tension and stress lines. Deeply moisturizes even severely dry skin as it relieves visible redness & encourages recovery.""<br /><br />Ingredients include Shea Butter & Macadamia Oil, Mirabilis Jalapa Plant Extract, Microalgae Extract.<br /><br />Included in this review are pictures of the literature on the box & tub for your review.<br /><br />I am very excited to add this Murad product to my collection of Murad skincare as I know I will enjoy using it as much as I enjoy using the other Murad skincare products I have in my arsenal.<br /><br />Having only used this now for a few days, this is a firstly impression review. I look forward to seeing a reduction in the redness on my face.<br /><br />Highly recommend ♡",1

Super easy to use and you can have professional looking lashes in 2 easy steps. This set has a nice variety of lash styles from every day to super dramatic which is nice.

This Murad hydration intense recovery cream has been such a great help for my dry, dull skin. The cream is thick so I apply small amount then I reapply the same amount. So far that method has been working out great for my skin. I use it at night time and I wake up to fresh and moisturized skin. Overall, I am happy with almost no scent cream product and the product itself is great. I would recommend to anyone who has dry and dull skin that need some rich hydration.

AEK3IYABOEGTXOTX7P6SBQJUP57A,B08KY7VYDS,4,2021-02-24 12:56:19.929,its not really the right size for a cat,id say this is more of a dog brush than a cat brush b/c of its size.  its actually quite large for even my sisters 3 super fat cats.  I always feel nervous about using a wire brush on a cat b/c they are notorious for always trying to bite the brush or rub their face on it.  im always so concerned about poking them in the eye.  all that being said... she LOVED the self cleaning feature of this brush.  I thought the button was just a press and release and the spikes would just keep popping up.  no... u press the button up and it holds it in place while the bristles disappear.  u then move ur finger over the button towards u and the button releases and the bristles pop out again.  I would say that the brush feels quite bulky in my larger girly hand.  my sister was concerned that the button would break over not that much time.  my vote is to use this specifically for a dog and buy a smaller brush with the same concept for a cat.  I hope this was helpful.,1
AESIZ3ATHVPMZM5NI6ZJOZBH547A,B08GKVYS1Y,5,2021-02-24 14:29:44.316,So many options!,"I've never tried this brand before so I was curious to get to testing. Before using on my nails, I did some testers to see the outcome. The confetti ones I did on a white gel color base, one of the glittery ones I did on black. I love the grey with the subtle glitter in it. Everything applied smoothly with no lumps, except for one (not pictured in the testers, but the top left in the company's photos). That one was a bit odd but maybe for someone with more finesse and skill. This set comes with base, top and matte top coat. The glittery ones have good pigment to them, you don't need any color base to make them pop. In my photo, I only did one coat. I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I do my own and some friends' nails on a regular basis. They're super excited to do the green for St Patrick's day and the confetti ones for Easter.

But with my hair growing out during the pandemic, it was time I owned a brush. I like that it's pretty and wooden (to match my comb). And, it's small enough that I can easily stick it in my makeup caddy.<br /><br />I also like the way it feels. It has 2 types of bristles: boar bristles and round, metal, nylon-tipped pins. The bristles reach your scalp for a nice scratchy massage. They also do a nice job of smoothing when I want to put my hair up in a ponytail.",1

The primer gives a really great base and helps the foundation to look smooth and not crack, the ONLY downside is that for me, it doesn't allow my skin to breathe enough and I end up with breakouts if use it more than on the odd occasion which is a shame.  That being said a little goes a very long way, and on the days when I need my make up to be extra perfect then this gives me great results!",1

The rest are glitters and I did notice there were a few that looked like duplicates but will have to see how they apply once in the nail.

AEZG2W4TRMMNFFAWS2BPQE676K4Q,B06ZYWVSZY,4,2021-02-24 22:44:41.406,"Honestly Strange And Frustrating, But The End Result Is Great","I really enjoy using the Alteya Organics rose water, so I was very excited to try this rose face organic sunscreen SPF 30. This sunscreen is very unique to me in that it isn’t white, it isn’t simply beige tinted, but looks dusty rose/beige tinted.<br /><br />So there are definitely some things about this product that I kind of dislike/ am on the fence about, but ultimately, The end result is surprisingly awesome.<br /><br />What I don’t like-<br />I usually start with what I like, but I noticed all the things I didn’t like very quickly, so I’ll start with that.<br /><br />-The pump dispenser. I don’t know what is going on with this thing, but I opened the box and tried pumping a couple times- nothing came out. I thought nothing of it since it usually takes multiple or many pumps initially to get any product into the pump..... but it never came. I started shaking the bottle and then pumping..... nothing. I almost gave up, but then violently started pumping it by hammering the top with my hand-tiny little bits started to splash out. After some more hammering, it seems to start coming out normally with a simple press. The product it pretty thick, so that could have been a factor I suppose? Now it is easier for it to come out, but still stops occasionally. When I press, the product usually comes out at the very end of a full pump.<br />-Not incredibly easy to spread and rub in properly. It isn’t terrible and I wasn’t too surprised since it is fairly thick and it is sunscreen, but it did require some effort to work it into my skin.<br />-It feels somewhat grainy/gritty when I’m trying to rub it into my skin. I’m not sure why or if it is just the product I received. I can’t feel any granules on my face after application, but it was definitely there initially which I thought was odd.<br />-I had a sensation of wanting to wash my hands afterwards. I could definitely feel it lingering on my fingers.<br /><br />After all that, I felt a little disappointed... but you know what? I really like the end result and the way it makes me look.<br /><br />What I like-<br /><br />-Really subtle natural scent- almost like the smell of clay with a hint of rose. I like it. I do see in the ingredients that there is also lavender oil.<br />-The tinted color... it is like a dusty rose beige. I really like it. I have somewhat tannish olive skin and something about this color is making my skin look good. It is almost like I’m wearing light makeup. Somehow my skin looks brighter and glowy after application.<br />-Doesn’t feel so heavy as I’m wearing. I’ll admit- the product is thick, feels somewhat grainy with application, and is not the easiest to rub in, but it feels light sitting on my face. Yes, even after washing hands, I can feel it is there when I run my fingers across my face, but it feels soft. There is a little bit of friction like it doesn’t feel completely silky smooth, but I’m not bothered by it.<br />-Doesn’t leave a white cast. I suppose this isn’t surprising since it isn’t white to begin with.... but I love that. Does it leaves cast? Kind of, but in a good way. Like I said, I feel like it leaves a very slight color that evens out my skin, almost like light makeup.<br /><br />I really wanted to leave a 3 star rating because the pump is annoying and frustrating, the grittiness is strange, and it isn’t the easiest to rub in, but darn I like how my skin looks afterwards!!! It doesn’t make any sense to me. It almost feels like it would leave my skin feeling and looking greasy/oily, but it doesn’t- my skin looks nice and somewhat dewy.<br /><br />If the company finds a way to make the pump dispenser work properly and possibly make it feel easier to apply then this would without a doubt be a 5 star product! I also wish the bottle was larger than 50ml, especially considering the hassle of the pump.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope my review was helpful in some way, and if so. I would love to know!! Thanks!!",1

The ends of the bands (which are wrapped in coordinating colored cloth which is awesome!) is squared.

Not sure if you are truly running around and active where they may continue to poke you through the day - have not worn mine long enough yet - and today is a calm day anyway.  Not sure why they made the pretty end so squared...<br /><br />Otherwise these headbands are very nice. Nicer than I though they would be.  I actually thought they may look far too childish but in actuality they are very nice looking - simple yet flirty.  They do not look infantile in any way.  They also fit pretty well and are comfortable to wear - except for the pokey bottoms.  I also thought that the colors would be an issue as I am not much of a pastel person but because they are thin it really is not an issue.  I think they will go along with a lot of clothes - even if it picks up just a hint of a color that you may have on.

This Murad cream is more dense than I expected, but not in a bad way. Goes on smoothly and keeps my skin feeling hydrated. A little bit does a great job so this will last a while. My only hang up with some Murad products is the fragrance they use sometimes. Thankfully there is no added fragrance in this cream so I'm very happy. There's a light scent to it but nothing overbearing. No irritations or issues. Recommended for sure if it's in your budget!",1

The lotion’s consistency is slightly runny but not liquidy.<br />Overall, this product has been helping me falling asleep, I even apply during the day to my arms and hands because the lotion smells so good. If you’re looking for a natural scented body lotion, this would be appropriate. I would recommend this product. Plus, Kneipp doesn’t test on animal.",1

The hype is real, and this is no exception. I use it at night before bed. A little amount smooths on nicely, making my face feel instantly moisturized without feeling greasy or heavy. It definitely feels like it has more youthful plumpness to it (I’m 37). It absorbs pretty fast, within about 10 min I can no longer feel it on my face. Since using it I haven’t felt any tightness in my skin. It has a nice clean soap like fresh scent to it. It hasn’t caused my skin to breakout either.  I love it and I highly recommend it!",1

Decent performance.","At a spa, people go into the steamroom to relax muscles, open pores and detoxify. This device isn't a steamroom but aims at providing some of the same benefits to the face and neck, especially regarding the skin and pores. This device heats water up to 104F, creating steam which is expelled from the golden rim outlet. Unfortunately it cannot handle the addition of essential oils,  recommending only pure water (or weak alkaline mineral water). This would have been a fantastic ability and function. Oh well. As a pure water streaming device, it is a decent performer.<br />It does not take long for the water to heat, about 30 seconds, and a fine steam mist is pushed out from the device. The optimum range is 6 - 10 inches away from the steam port. It's a good idea to start at a 12 inch distance, and ease your face closer, gauging your skins tolerance.<br />(Note: you can add toner that can fully dissolve into the water. The key is not to have a viscous liquid, or particulates, which will adversely affect the atomization.)<br />We found operation to be fairly simple and easy. Fill the water reservoir, put reservoir back into it's position. turn on the unit, within 30 seconds face gets a spa steam experience.<br />Is this as effective as those face steamers that have a cone that keeps the steam contained? No, because the steam floats freely. But, it's also multiples cheaper than those kinds of facial steaming devices. This is a credible portable device, that is compact enough that it won't take up much counter space. It's minimalist design will allow it to fit in with most decor.<br />It's easy to set up and operate. It's acceptably effective.<br />Also included with this steaming device is a mini misting device,  a headband (with pink ears) and 4 skin care tools (intended to help treat acne and blackheads).<br />The mini misting device does not heat the water you put in it. Rather, via a rechargeable battery, a touch of the button will spray a fine mist. This is very handy in the summer, when you might want a spritz of water to help cool you when outside. It's an apt complement to the facial steaming device.<br />I found the facial steaming device to be capable of decent performance. If you have realistic expectations, you'll enjoy this product. And, I like the rechargeable portable misting device.<br />Overall, a worthwhile product set, which earns a 4.5 - 4.75 star rating, with a high level recommendation.",1

I've been finding out lately how the hemp plant can make you more beautiful and even lose weight and cause your skin to be clear. This hair shine product is the icing on the cake of your hemp expenditures.<br /><br />The scent of this oil is very mild and pleasant. The oil is such a fine mist that it does not weight down the hair and seems to absorb well leaving a glossy shine. I saw this product a while ago and finally purchased some for myself! It will impress you with its natural ingredients and beautifying effects.

I have not ever heard of this brand or used it before now and since getting it have heard great things about certain products from this little kit. I will say from this kit my favorite is the primer in the squeeze tube that I add in with a matte primer and it does a great job at minimizing pores which is something I have a problem with on my nose,cheeks and chin and this does a great job at covering up those problem areas and looks great under makeup. I wasnt the biggest fan of the 2 other primers and havent really played with them a whole lot not in comparison to the one in the squeeze tube.

While I don't use face masks every day, it has taken me a while to use just a few of them, and specific masks, like the hydration mask, aren't best suited for my face type. Out of the whole set, my favorite masks have been the brightening and antioxidant masks. While I was slightly hesitant to use the antioxidant mask at first due to my oily combo skin, it left me with no clogged pores or irritation, and it brightened and soothed my skin.<br /><br />As I mentioned initially, I don't use face masks too often, and the masks I usually use are pretty cheap. Trying these masks has ruined me a little because it will be hard to go back to my regular masks. The one thing I don't like about these masks is the price. I think $42 is a little bit much for seven face masks, but it depends on how often you use face masks and how much of a splurge you want them to be. in terms of quality, I think the Karuna masks are great.",1

They are cobalt blue, and really stand out from the usual amber tints. The bottle itself is well-made and sturdy. The included caps (2 were provided) are of excellent quality, with polycone inserts to maintain an air-tight, leak proof seal. The included sprayers (2 were provided) are functional, but rather cheap in terms of build quality, especially the trigger. It also comes with a tiny little funnel that is way undersized and pretty useless given the bottle volume, and a few black labels (which require a white pen, which is NOT included).<br /><br />Each bottle comes in a bubble pack sleeve, but the box itself is rather thin with limited protection. These are a notch below other bottles I've received when it comes to manufacturer-provided protective packing. Still, the bottles did not break or chip in transit.<br /><br />The bottles needed a good wash before use since the outside had some type of greasy-feeling film. I would have washed them regardless of their condition, but these definitely needed a good washing before use.<br /><br />Taking everything into consideration I'll rate these as 4 stars. Well worth considering if you need a more colorful option than amber and don't expect to be using the sprayer much (or at all).",1

Most lotions that have lavender either smell like nothing or smell like an entire shop of flowers. Those lotions that do get the scent right usually are full of chemicals.<br /><br />I had never heard of Kneipp before but I really like it. This lotion is not thin, but if you are used to a thick cream it will seem thinner. It does take a little work to absorb, but it is worth it. The scent is not overpowering and I think it does not linger, but is just right.<br /><br />One complaint I do have is that the bottle had no safety seal. For $18 I would think the tube would come with a seal on the top. I was not sure if the bottle had already been used and returned. I just decided to go ahead and be brave and I'm still alive. Kneipp needs to add a seal on their tubes.<br /><br />This is not a sticky or overwhelming lotion and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.

It makes you think they are supposed to be used with an LED light, but they are not. Upon opening one of the mask packages, I wasn't expecting a gooey, in between a cream and lotion, to start leaking out. It's not like a Serum at all.<br />The mask itself is quite thin, but it's not at all easy to tear. I read that one reviewer commented that it rips easily. On the contrary, it's quite difficult to even tear it. I actually had to use scissors to cut it for a use that I will explain later. It is a good size, covering all areas quite well. The cutouts for the eyes are quite small, which I like because it really gets to the under-eye area without it getting into your eyes.<br />I left it on for 20 minutes, and then did as another reviewer did, and cut it up and put it on my neck & decollete for another 20 minutes, with the rest of the cream/lotion that was left in the package.<br />This mask is extremely moisturizing and did not sink into my skin completely afterwards. I had used Retin-A the night before, so my face was quite dry, and really needed moisture and nutrients. But, I think it is a little too oily for my skin. My skin was still so oily hours later that I had to blot it with a microfiber facial cloth. The next day my skin felt great, though, without any ill effects.<br />These are very moisturizing and emollient masks, and would be great for someone with extremely dry skin. For me, I think these will work well using them once a week or every other week, when my skin is at its driest. For five masks, I think the price point is just right. I would definitely recommend these. Especially for those with very dry skin.",1

I usually wear my glasses when I am using eye patches at night and have never experienced any that tore during use but these did.

We are going to have to look up the best removal method for dip powder, but the top coat does dry quickly and is very smooth and shiny.<br /><br />Looking at the polish you can almost see the granulated powders.

I feel like the brush is more intense and the silicone head is more gentle on the skin.  I can really notice a difference after I use the brush.  My skin is much smoother.  I assume it's because it's exfoliating and removing the dead skin.  There are 2 speed settings and I've found the lower setting doesn't do much so I use it on the higher setting.  I like that it can be used in the shower since I wash my face in the shower.  I just wish it was rechargeable.  I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, but nowadays it seems that most electronics are rechargeable so I guess I'm used to that.",1

A good tea canister is not cheap, so I didn't have sticker shock with this product.<br /><br />Thankfully, the company thoughtfully puts out refill packs of this delicious and calming tea.<br />I'll definitely be ordering a refill because not only do I like it myself, but after going through so many different calming and sleep inducing teas, this is my spouse's absolute favorite. Not just because of the taste, but it helps her to totally relax and even sleep throughout the night. Other teas and sleep formulations such as melatonin and valerian supplements just don't do the trick.<br />For me, it's more about the delightful taste. Slightly floral, slightly sweet. Yes, it does relax me and is helpful as part of a nighttime ritual, but not as much as my spouse. We both love it but for different reasons.<br /><br />And I just adore the look of the canister. A lovely gloss ceramic, with an Art Deco nod, that fits in any decor. No hiding it, it's proudly on the counter, ready for anytime you need a little tea comfort.",1

Surprisingly strong brushing action (and a little loud, to be honest), on both the speeds it offers. I don't believe it's a true sonic brush, but then it isn't priced like one either.<br /><br />The battery life is impressive - a full charge overnight the first day, then 3 weeks of brushing every day (mostly!) and it still has charge.<br />Instructions were clear and detailed, no complaints there. The handle is very slim, some of these power brushes have chunky handles, so this one is a more comfortable fit for smaller hands. Look after the charging cable, it's a small pin on the end that plugs into the handle, not a mini / micro USB shape.<br /><br />One downside is that the brush heads are specific to this brand; you can buy a new set of four for $10 but after a year of use (4 included brushes x 3 months each) it's probably easier to get everything new.",1

In this set you get 6 beautiful colors in the purple scheme which is great. The colors are pretty rich in pigment and they blend quite nicely. All in all I am quite happy with this and for $12 this is not a bad price at all. It is an easy way to create an eye look with just one or two of these.",1

I have particularly been into the magnetic ones lately since they are insanely easy to use and don’t require a lengthy process. These particular magnetic lashes intrigued me because they come with multiple different style lashes instead of a bunch of the same and I was excited to give them a try!<br /><br />The magnetic liner itself is pretty bad, Though that’s not odd for the less expensive sets and I kind of expected it. It’s just a bit to hard to work with and I had to go over the eyeliner line multiple times to get it how I wanted it. It’s just a bit to runny. But I can just use a different liner so it’s not a big deal.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this set, and the reason why I gave it only 3 stars, it the quality and look of the lashes themselves. There really plastic feeling. Plus the magnetic strip on all of them is ridiculously thick. I’m not someone who likes that overly thick lash strip look, and much prefer a thinner band in my lashes. But these do stay on well and I had no issues with them applying to the liner and stating on throughout the day. If you like a thicker band then you might like these, but for me they just looked overly done.",0

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,B083B67373,5,2021-03-07 17:48:18.521,The LED aspect explained & my experience with these masks 🎭 (spoiler alert: I LOVE them!),"THIS IS A LENGTHY REVIEW, BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH THE READ:<br /><br />Avajar is a k-beauty skincare manufacturer out of Seoul, Korea, closely affiliated with the K-pop group, Super Junior, who is the face of the brand. Avajar, as a company, has been making face products since 2019, with a focus on offering quality ingredients at a fair price. In this particular product they have created (a series of) sheet masks that contain the same cream as their LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer. The original LED Ring Light Cream Moisturizer is pictured here on the sheet mask packaging. That moisturizer actually comes with a mini LED light on top of the jar, which was designed to be used as the product applicator. The LED cream in a jar was a top seller for Avajar, and so they expanded on the delivery system to include sheet masks. With all that being said, these masks do not come with an LED light (but if you already have one of your own, you could certainly use it with this product). I just wanted to pass this info along to clear up the confusion surrounding the marketing terms used on these masks.<br /><br />For context: My skin is dry and dehydrated, very sensitive and product reactive. I have not experienced any issues from using these masks, outside of some temporary erythemia (a.k.a. skin flushing, which I experience regularly). These masks are formulated without any artificial colors, fragrance, silicons, and parabens. This is not to say these masks are fragrance free, because they absolutely have a scent. The smell is rather herbal to me, which I believe is attributed to fruit and flower essences used in the cream. All Avajar products are made in a cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices) certified lab. However, I do not see any claims of cruelty-free status, neither on the package nor on their website.<br /><br />I do self care Sundays every week and will wear a sheet mask for 30 minutes while I relax in bed. Putting this mask on is pretty messy. You'll want to apply it over your bathroom sink because the cream is on the watery side and will drip everywhere. There is a generous amount of the cream essence inside the package and on the mask. The sheet mask material is super thin and hugs the contours of my face well. It's a nice size and sticks well, so you can actually wear one and move about, without having it lift or slide all over. After 30 minutes I peel the mask off and massage the remaining product into my skin. There isn't any stickiness and the cream absorbs nicely. My skin feels baby soft, supple, and deeply moisturized each time I use one. These masks come in a box of 5 and there's 3 formulas to choose from - Hydrating {blue} (which is the one I got), Whitening {yellow}, and Nourishing {red}. I have really enjoyed using these in my weekly sheet masks rotation. The price is extremely reasonable for such great quality. I love the results I've gotten and I recommend them entirely! I just purchased the Nourishing set and will definitely repurchase these hydrating masks when I run out.<br /><br />PRO'S:<br />+ Adds moisture to dry, dehydrated skin<br />+ Soothes and calms skin irritation<br />+ Skin feels soft, supple & deeply nourished after use<br />+ No artificial color, fragrance, silicon, parabens<br />+ Mask material hugs facial contours<br />+ Masks don't slip & slide off the face<br />+ Fast absorption - refreshes in 20-30 minutes<br />+ Comes in a pack of 5 at a cost of $1.55 a piece<br />+ Perfect for a relaxing self care session<br />+ Conveniently shipped on PRIME<br /><br />CONS:<br />- None",1

The cream itself has a pleasant but mild fragrance. The cream itself is very creamy and lightweight. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving behind any residue.<br /><br />The skin feels soft and smooth when you use this cream. I for one like how my skin feels when I use this.

If you have a tangled beard this will struggle a bit to get through it to be honest. Also if you have a coarse beard this also may struggle quite a bit. For shorter beards this will work quite well.

I have long, thick hair and sometimes after straightening my hair I just want to wash my body, I would have to tie or clip my hair up. But unfortunately, water still ends up wetting my hiar. The shower cap material is good quality. It is thick and waterproof. The cute, floral design is a plus and there is a cute bow in the front. Inside there is a silicone band that will hold the cap in place so I don't have to worry about the cap falling off. I have worn the cap around the house just to keep hair out of the way and it doesn't hurt my head. It has been super useful keeping my hair dry and style intact.",1

I have been purchasing different types of microfiber hair towels and I want to say this is one of the best out there. First of all, many claim that their product works for long hair but when I try them I usually get a good length of hair sticking out. The towel is never long enough to cover the length of my hair. However, I was so happy to find that this microfiber towel covered my entire hair. The towels are absorbent and keeps my hair drying nicely without the use of a hair dryer, which tends to create a lot of fizz. The only thing is that because the towel is longer and larger than usual, it tends to slip. I recommend wrapping the hair before tying on to the button to keep the towel tightly wrapped around your hair. Other than that, I have no complaints with the product.",1

I had heard of this Welle co brand before, but had never personally tried it prior to this. So I was really excited to give it a go.<br /><br />First impressions, the box it comes in is super luxe looking and very giftable. And the container that holds the tea bags is a very pretty purple color and is glass, giving you that premium look. However once I opened the container I was highly disappointed. They didn’t even splurge on the pyramid tea bags, they went with those cheap pouches. For this price point I expected much better if I’m being honest!<br /><br />Scent wise this tea smells like sweaty socks, it is not a pleasant smell and I highly recommend not even smelling it before brewing because it can easily put you off to drinking it. But once brewing I was surprised that the scent was almost fruity, so much better than in the container! The directions say to steep one to two bags for 2-10 minutes, in very hot but not boiling water. I usually like stronger tea, but with this I just can’t justify using 2 tea bags at that price point!<br /><br />Taste wise it actually has a very mild taste, and none of that sticky socks smell or taste at all. It’s very mild tasting with a slightly fruity/berry taste to it. Is it amazing? No, but it’s not bad. It’s definitely an acquired taste! I will say though that I have been sleeping like a baby the last few nights I have drank this, so even though it’s not my favorite tea it does seam to work, at least for me.",0

I wouldn't brag about or or anything like that, but at the same time it does do a nice job of hydrating the skin, and saturating well.  I did find that the cream was like whipped up, so being that it felt that it contained a bit of air, it didn't have the consistency that I like in creams, for them to be able to go a long way with only a little bit. That being said, it did saturate very nicely, and I found that it does a nice job if applied before bed, and in the morning, of keeping my skin well hydrated throughout the day.  The one thing I wasn't too crazy about was the scent.  I do not think that it is scented, but there is a natural smell that is a little weird.  I wouldn't really know how to describe it, but it's not terribly pleasant.  I wouldn't call it off putting either, but I'd rather it had a better overall smell.  That being said, it did perform well as a hydrating cream, and whether or not it prevents damage from your environment is difficult to judge really.",1

This wasn't completely clear on the product page, so I want to make note of it. Basically, the mister is a nice thing you can use to cool down and refresh your skin on the go.<br />- Packaging suggests two different types of water for the steamer and mister respectively.<br />  - steamer = distilled water<br />  - mister = mineral water<br />- The steamer's cord is about 2.5 feet long, which is something you will want to consider when decided where you will be most likely to use the steamer.<br />- The little extras like the headband with ears and the pore clearing tools make this a great gift to give someone who enjoys getting and giving facials.<br />- The manufacturer warns that acne which is hormonal in nature will not respond to the steamer<br />- The instructions also advise you not to use the steamer everyday, nor more than 10 minutes at a time. Accordingly, this is not something that is likely to add a lot of time to your daily routine, but rather something you will use once or twice a week.<br />- The steamer itself is cute and compact, so you're not giving up a huge amount of space if you get one, nor do you necessarily have to hide it in between uses, unless you want to.<br />- The steam produced is hot/warm and there is no way to control the temperature; however, you can easily regulate how you experience the heat simply by adjusting the proximity of your face to the steamer.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this facial steamer set as a purchase for yourself or as a gift for someone else who enjoys giving/getting spa treatments at home.<br />I personally like the effect it had on my skin; I felt as though using it has helped with both the cleansing and hydration of my skin.<br />Once you get through all the instructions, procure the right type of water for your steamer, and identify where you want to set it up, you will be rewarded with an easy to use machine that produces copious amounts of steam very rapidly",1

To some that may seem like a nice trip to the spa but for me I am highly cautious about things so I havent yet decided if I am going to use this or not. This comes packaged as most bath salts that I buy and they look just like bath salts when you open the package. However your suppose to use the entire 10 oz bag in one bath and sit for 20-30 mins I usually will use about a cup at most of Dr Teals bath salts so that to me seemed excessive followed by a sweat and rest afterwards which no female is crazy about sweat let alone in your own bed.

The ingredients seem relatively standard other than the addition of caffeine.  While I like the roller and packaging and the way this feels when applying, I am not noticing any results.  The serum applies *very* thinly... you can barely tell anything has come out of the roller at all.  Because I didn’t experience any effect I thought that maybe the issue was a lack of serum actually being applied and so I started applying it more frequently, and still no noticeable effect for me.  It does provide some moisturization, without leaving a sheen, but doesn’t work as well as another serum that I have used (which also has a very similar roller type application).

The scent lasts a long time. So I decided to use this on my decolletage (my chest area) I usually like to bring my skincare down into that area anyway. This way the strong yet beautiful floral scent is there but so is the skincare benefits. I recommend this if you don't mind putting alot off fragrance on your face.

But comfortable.","I'm giving this 4 stars because it's one of the most comfortably suncreens I've tried.  However, there are other things to note.  First the scent; I'm obsessed with rosewater, and I expected this to have a rosewater scent.  However, it doesn't smell of roses (or like sunscreen) at all;  I actually dislike the oddly medicinal smell, but fortunately it disappears quickly.  Also, it has a slight, small gritty texture (and I have not encountered in suncreen before); this also doesn't linger.  The textured is watery and easy to distribute.  The tint is very much the color of calamine lotion (really), but it's watery and thin so it doesn't show up that color once distributed.  I have fair, neutral skin, and I think the effect is actually flattering.  However, I am not at all sure how well it will or won't server darker skins.

AHCR53CDYDQAS6C5TZXQWB4PWTCQ,B07YV9J2YZ,4,2021-03-16 01:43:41.251,Renaissance head bands,"These headbands are extremely soft not only on the top but also on the bottom. They are wider in width so they have a very light feel on the head. They are larger and the puffiness on the top of them gives them a Renaissance feel. Inside the satin fabric that is braided, there are pearls throughout. The pearl accents give it an extra something special. They do feel very old world to me and they look adorable with outfits I put my daughter in. She has worn them with both dresses and pants.  I have had an occasional pearl accent fall off so they are more delicate than I would have hoped for.",1

They are thinner in width and have enough gives that they work well for both children and adult heads. While the plastic is covered in a soft material that is ruched, the ends are a little bit harder. They have been folded but there is some glue and they aren’t completely without flaw.  I would say quality falls into the average lane.  Some of them have more glue visible than others but overall they’ve been done well enough. The key for the area that goes behind the ears is to position it so it’s not directly on the skin but more on hair. Another thing I like about these hairbands is that the set contains a large variety of colors.  Literally any outfit color or style should have a match in this set.",1

AGJS5RN6QYCYPGH42JZGQFFOSXKQ,B08P27T7RZ,4,2021-03-16 17:03:59.771,"Look great, easy to apply, hard to remove","I'm a false eyelash beginner and I have to say that magnetic lashes are far easier to apply, in my opinion, because the magnetic pull as you get the lashes close to their intended destination help you place them properly. They also seem to be a little more forgiving than traditional adhesive lashes if you need to slightly reposition them. This set has a great variety of styles and lengths and comes with two tubes of magnetic liner and a pair of eyelash calipers to help set them in place. If you're just starting out with lashes, this is a great way to do it.<br /><br />However, there are some downsides. First, I find the eyeliner extremely irritating to my eyes (and my nose, as it is heavily scented). It is also really difficult to remove (I have to soak my eyelids with Bi-Facil on a cotton pad at least twice and then follow up with micellar water and MAYBE that will get all of it off). Be prepared to soak your lashes, because that's the only way this stuff is coming off. Second, I find the lashes somewhat uncomfortable. They feel heavier on the lid than adhesive lashes and I can often feel the metal on the band. I tend to remove these long before I remove a pair of adhesive lashes because I am never NOT aware of them on my lids. Third, if you use a tweezer/caliper thing to place your lashes, do yourself a favor and just buy a decent one. This one is plastic and has no tension, so you have to manually open it to fix the lashes in it, then fiddle with it again to take it away from the lashes. For me this was a bonus, because I got so frustrated with it, I just learned to do it with my hands with much better results.<br /><br />Despite my problems with this set, I would totally recommend trying this out to see if magnetic lashes are for you. The variety of styles will give you a lot of options to experiment with different looks, but do take care of your eyelids and make sure you have appropriate product to remove the tenacious eyeliner. Happy lashing!",1

Its kind of crazy, but between going through IVF treatments, a pregnancy that we were on pins and needles about, and then COVID hitting, I haven't had my hair colored or been inside of a salon since January 2019. Now that I have a 13 month old, finding time by myself to go is nearly impossible.<br /><br />With that said, my hair is crazy long and healthy. But going through postpartum, I ended up with some hair loss that is now in the process of growing back. I used to love getting Keratin treatments in the salon because it always made my hair feel so good, look super shiny and healthy, and just overall made me feel good. I was anxious to try this at home Keratin system to see if I could get similar results, and much to my surprise, I did! Not only is it easy to do, but my hair looks, and feels so much healthier! It really did wonders on smoothing out some of the frizzy dead ends that need trimmed, and created a sort of gloss look overtop my hair. It brightened up my naturally dark ashy hair color, and was just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for anyone with long hair looking to revitalize your long locks!",1

The wooden handle is ergonomic, and the longer bristles coupled with boars bristles make fast work of unruly hair. Both my toddler and I have wavy, relatively thick hair, and we're able to get it under control with this brush. It's priced right (under $10 when I got it), and the quality really seems higher than expected for that price range. Just be aware, when they say small, they mean small. My wife's standard sized hair brush is considerably larger. If you need something bigger, this may not be the best option, but if you have fairly short hair and are okay with a smaller brush, this one is great.<br /><br />***I write reviews as a hobby because I love trying out electronics, clothing, household products, kitchen devices, and more.

I think with more practice I could get the hang of it. Also my lids are not tight as they were when I was younger and so it does take a little bit more figuring out with applying the magnetic eyeliner. I used what were the smaller thinnest one and once I get it a little better figured out, I will probably need to trim them towards the center, but I didn't want to do it until I can get better practice to make sure I have it correctly. They definitely do make a difference as you can see with only one on.<br />On one eye, I had put on a lot more magnetic liner as it was my first one and was trying to figure it out and taking it off was quite difficult. It had said to do two-three layers and I felt that was too much for my eye because I probably had about 3 layers in some sections and I couldn't get it all off at night because my eyelid was starting to get irritated. I used coconut oil and warm/hot water with a facial brush and cotton pads and it was difficult to get the eyeliner off.<br />Due to the pandemic I don't have many places to go and with all the work it took to do it & get it off, not sure how soon I will do it again.

Not safe. 2 Stars ⭐,"After going over the ingredients in these products, the only two I would feel even remotely safe using would be this shampoo and conditioner. As a hair stylist, you do not want to use a product that contains formaldehyde and apply heat to it. You certainly do not want to use it every 6 weeks, as it's harmful to your health. It can cause breathing issues among other things. It's very hard to believe that I even saw actual formaldehyde on the back of this product, and so high up in the ingredients list.<br />Even hair stylist must wear protective gear, such as gloves, aprons, masks, and be trained how to safely work with this hazardous chemical. Salons must have adequate ventilation and follow strict protocols regarding blow dryer temperatures and monitor formaldehyde levels at all times when they provide Keratin Treatments containing formaldehyde because of the immediate and long term health dangers.This is something you cannot possibly do at home.<br />Also, the pretreatment that you add to the shampoo is extremely strong and stripping to your hair. When they say add just a little, no one knows what that means. That particular product, or the two main ingredients, should only be a small percentage of the product you're adding it to. I don't think you can mix this properly at home without causing damage to your hair and/or your skin.<br />I ""might"" use the shampoo and conditioner, but I will not touch the pre-treatment nor will I touch the DIY home keratin treatment. Over the course of a few treatments, I can see this product going really awry for some people. They will end up with damaged hair and possibly other problems. It is not safe. I absolutely would not recommend it!",0

It's pretty elegant, especially for tea.  I would expect a high-end candle to look like this, not a canister of tea!  It's beautiful, but again, for tea.  The box is nice with a soft, thick elastic band to keep the top on.  The jar is a light purple glass with a plastic lid.  They did slap a warning about the horrific smell when you open the cap.  It's pretty bad and strong.  However, I bravely pushed on and made a cup.  It doesn't really smell that bad once it's steeped.  I steep it in 195 degree water for 7 minutes.  It does seem to take the edge off, but the flavor is really just okay.  At $68 (currently) for 50 tea bags, I think the packaging must be really expensive.  I usually drink Yogi Bedtime Tea because it's readily available at the grocery store and I love the way it smells and tastes.  While I think this WelleCo tea seems to be more effective, I really would prefer to just drink a cup of nice-tasting tea before bed.",0

Its in the middle of pack with regards to price….some quick research shows that 8 or 9 dollars is ballpark for about a 4 to 5  ounce item of this kind, and remember this has traveled a long way, so there's a cost element to that! You can get more ounces for the same price from household name brands and you can pay a lot more for niche products.<br /><br />The tube comes wrapped in plastic for protection and there's a foil cap under the lid. Once you're in, the product is like a thick paste, but not difficult to squeeze out. You don't need a lot, a pea-sized amount foams up well once you've added water. The packaging only refers to an 'appropriate' amount, whatever that means, but a little goes a long way. The smell is very pleasant, a natural and subtle lemon. The foam feels like it cleans thoroughly, my face felt less oily. The Vitamin C that's included claims to improve uneven skin but I didn't notice a big change there.<br /><br />I like this product - its an honest, unpretentious cleanser that doesn't make any unrealistic claims, it smells good and it would work for everyday use, for the whole family.

It smells very floral and light. It feels good, I use this in my skincare routine before a moisturizer, after I get out of the shower.

It came beautifully packaged in a tall slender box (which I didn't want to throw away). The component is a peachy colored but clear plastic slender bottle with a plastic shiny gold cap & bottom. The serum has pretty petals floating around in it. The description says, ""delicate vegan petals dissolve on contact,"" however the few pumps that I used had no petals come out with the clear Gelèe serum.<br /><br />The floral scent was very strong & while it did dissipate a bit after being rubbed on my test spot, it did linger, hence the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I'm just not a fan of strong fragrances in facial skin care.<br /><br />The serum rubbed in sheer & was quickly absorbed. I used it first on the back of my very dry hands and didn't see much of a difference when compared to my other hand.<br /><br />Despite the beauty of the component, I don't think I will be using it on my face because I just couldn't get past the lingering scent.

AHSV4TYSAX52BIHH7PLZRD44KZHA,B08NC4378M,3,2021-03-28 20:36:28.589,Very oily,"Bottom line - this nail polish does what it’s supposed to do, I just don’t love it as much as I was hoping I would.<br />The first reason for this is that it’s oily - it leaked during shipping, so about a quarter of the shipping box was soaked in oil. Of course, since it leaked it’s all over the bottle, and since it’s oil, it’s not terribly fun to clean up. Even if it didn’t leak, I don’t love the oiliness. It definitely sticks around on your hands when you use it.<br />The second reason is the smell - as soon as I opened the shipping box, I could smell it and at first I thought it smelled wonderful, like a rainbow cherry flavored candy cane, although the smell was incredibly strong. Riding in my car with it for a few minutes, my husband and I both could smell it for the rest of the day, and leaving it in the car while we shopped for maybe an hour, the smell was overpowering when we came back out to the car. So, I let it sit in the box for a few days hoping the smell would eventually die down; it did, but when actually using the polish, it doesn’t have this same nice smell. It smells a bit like vinegar, or something similar - definitely not like acetone, and not like flowers which is like I was worried about, but still not great. Personally, I’d prefer the smell of acetone.<br />Finally, the bottle - it has a convenient flip cap and a pump you press down to dispense it which is supposed to be convenient, but in reality, it makes a mess. I think this is possibly because you have to push fairly hard on it to get any out. But, as I said, this nail polish remover does work pretty well. I used it on a polish with tiny holo glitter in it, and had no problems, and my husband had no problems getting it to remove foil or plain creme polish. Essentially, the thing both of us really don’t like about it is the oiliness. The other things we could deal with, but because of the oiliness we won’t be buying this product again after this bottle. However, if that wouldn’t bother you, we think this is a great option if you’re looking for an alternative to acetone.<br />I have provided a picture of my bottle - you can see the oiliness around the edges of the label, and you can somewhat see the oil still all over the bottle. Note that I did clean the bottle off before I used it, and have kept it upright and in a plastic bag since then - it’s just a messy product.",0

It did not tinted my skin like other acetone based nail polish removers. It also left my toes a little oily, which is also something totally different to what I am used to after removing nail polish because it's usually the opposite.<br />The touch dispenser bottle is awesome, just push it down and your cotton ball will get wet avoiding spills.

I don't have the kind of body that can go with using only deodorant, and often times even antiperspirant fails.  This Nivea deodorant really does work for getting rid of odor, and because it dried in the armpit, it seems to make a seal that stops sweat a bit.  One word of warning...this deodorant has a REALLY STRONG scent.  If you are bothered by fragrances, you may not like this at all.  It definitely clashes with perfume for a few hours of wear, and if applied at night, I found the fragrance to be annoying and it game me a headache. There are other aluminum-free Nivea formula with different fragrances that I'm going to try to see if their perfume is less pungent.

I've pictured it next to a full sized bag of Dr. Teal's Magnesium salts, for reference. You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck here. This bag of Magnesium flakes is fragrance free, so you have more options as well. You can scent the portions individually, (if you so choose), by adding a few drops of your favorite essential oils, or you can simply use it as-is. The flakes dissolve quicker than any of the commercially prepared salts I've ever used, which make these perfect for soaking. Skin is baby soft after a 20 minute bath, and muscle fatigue is greatly reduced. Magnesium Chloride soaks have helped my husband's charlie horses become far less frequent. Unfortunately he can't absorb Magnesium from his diet, so we have to supplement. Without this and high quality vitamins, he would suffer.<br /><br />There are some things I didn't realize when I ordered this product, but I found to be very interesting after researching the difference between Magnesium Chloride vs. Magnesium Sulfate:<br /><br />Both compounds contain a similar level of elemental Magnesium, but the key difference between Magnesium Chloride (flakes) and Magnesium Sulphate (salts) is the purity of Magnesium Chloride and the rate of its absorption within the body. It is reported that Magnesium Chloride is more easily absorbed and utilised by the body, compared to Epsom Salts.<br /><br />This seems like a much better choice for our needs. I'm so glad to have discovered that something better like this exists, to help his condition.",1

They use a lip gloss applicator and the fuzz started coming off the first time I used it.  I am now using bare plastic to apply it.  (just ordered some eyeliner wands to replace...hope they fit the tube)<br /><br />GONNA JUMP IN HERE WITH MY LATEST UPDATE IN CASE YOU'RE TEMPTED TO STOP READING.  Still love this product and....YAAAYYYYY....my latest (direct) order has BRUSHES instead of foam/fuzz things on the wands.  They earned a fifth star for this.  So happy!<br /><br />UPDATE:  Three months later and all the peeling areas on my nails are gone.  I've had no more splitting and my nails are definitely stronger (I insist on using them inappropriately sometimes and they no longer show signs of wear and tear at their tips.)<br /><br />I think the people upset with lack of progress are either not using the product as recommended (twice a day) or just aren't waiting enough time.  This is not an overnight fix or a magic ""blink and your nails will be longer"" elixir.  Your nails need to grow normally but, being stronger, will attain length without breaking.<br /><br />NOTE:  I file my nails daily (in one direction) with a fine glass file to make sure there are no rough edges from day to day.  I've done this for years, though...it's not the reason my nails are so much better now.<br /><br />Expensive? Yes.  Worth it?  Absolutely.<br /><br />FINAL UPDATE: Since I also use a cuticle oil that supposedly has strengthening properties, I decided to ask the Rejuvica people two questions (separate customer service representatives). This product does NOT penetrate the nail...it stays on the surface.  And if you wash your hands, the product washes off. I'm going to stop using this product when it runs out.  If my nails suffer, I'll go back to using it but put some kind of protective wax product over it immediately.  If my nails continue to look good, I'll just stick with my cuticle oil (Barefoot Scientist).",0

This seems best for those who don’t need heavy hydration and enjoy a lavender scent.<br /><br />This lotion does have a moderately strong lavender scent that even lingers on my hands after washing. It smells nice and doesn’t bother me, but it may bother those sensitive to fragrance as this is just in the range of what I can tolerate as strong lavender has been a headache trigger for me. This lotion has retinyl palmitate, which is especially risky mixed with sun exposure.

AGPGFFJDCKXPNBWCC5YP2ZUDPNGA,B08NC4378M,5,2021-03-31 00:13:53.253,Smells like Hawaiian Punch 😋 Great formula and I love the no-spill pump bottle!,"This non-acetone polish remover from Plant Therapy smells so good! To me, it smells a lot like fruit punch (Hawaiian Punch, to be exact). You can smell it from the outside of the bottle as soon as it arrives. But don't smell it straight from the bottle, or on your cotton round... the solvents themselves have a very strong odor! After you use the product though, the only thing lingering is the fruit punch scent on your fingertips. There is a little bit of an oily residue left behind, but it beats the ashy dryness of straight acetone.<br /><br />The leak-proof pump bottle works amazing! If you knock the bottle over, it does not spill. I love that! The cap on the bottle flips up to reveal the pump dispenser, which you press down to pull your liquid to the top. I did not have any issues during shipment, so I think this bottle will be fabulous for travel. This acetone-free formula removes traditional crème & shimmer polishes with little effort. The solvent base contains Ethyl Acetate & Isopropyl Mistrate. I wouldn't use this as my first defense against removing glitter lacquers, and I wouldn't use it to soak off gel polish at all. (Pure acetone is best for both of those options).<br /><br />Plant Therapy products are proudly made in the USA! 🇺🇸",1

It was my first time doing gel nail and I loved it, but I didn't realize gel polish needs to be removed using a special technique. That's how I came across with this remover kit and I am glad I ordered it. I guess some people wrap aluminum foil around their nails, but I don't know how efficient that is. After I dipped the cotton pads in nail polish remover, I wrapped them around my nails and put the nail clippers on for 15 minutes. When I took them off, the gel polish looked soft and some of them were already peeled, so I used the scrapper to get rid of the rest of the polish, and filed my nails to smooth them out. That's it! This kit is very easy to use and does the job.",1

To me, it smells very much like a Pina Coloda, but not over powering just a nice fresh scent.<br /><br />The scrub itself is has a medium sized grit, and its feels fairly ""sharp"" against the skin.  Also, this isn't great for rubbing on and then taking a long soak in a tub, it turns the water black.

These fragrance free products are exceptional for my hyperpigmentation and skin tone issues, dry skin and skin texture. These don’t irritate my dry and sensitive skin and seem well suited to any skin types.<br /><br />I’ve used 20% L-Ascorbic acid for many years and worked up from 5% to 20% over time as it can sting, itch or irritate the skin to go straight to a high 20% concentration. I’ve been using this Universal C Serum since last year (before this sample kit) and had no stinging this time and had only temporary, slight stinging when I first tried the C serum last year as I wasn’t using my Vitamin C serum as routinely for a short period.<br /><br />With regular use at least 1x a day, the Universal C Serum brightens my skin and evens my skin tone. While it didn’t go away 100%, this serum flattened and faded a large brown spot on my jawline so much it became barely visible. It also faded smaller brown spots on my cheeks. The serum makes my skin smoother and it seems a bit firmer. Vitamin C is an excellent antioxidant for long term anti aging benefits too.<br /><br />I apply the Universal C Serum after cleansing and toning and follow with the Essence (Squalene drops) and Moisture Boost. The Moisture Boost feels lightweight and nongreasy, but it’s super moisturizing when I mix in a couple Squalane drops. The texture of my dry skin feels so silky and smooth, and my skin feels comfortable and amply hydrated all day. These products provide real benefits for me. Love this set. 5 stars.",1

This sunscreen feels quite gentle and does not seem to irritate my skin at all. It adds a light but effective level of hydration without feeling heavy. It is a chemical sunscreen, so zero white cast. It is thin, and goes on like a light lotion. Typical viscosity among my other K-beauty brands.<br /><br />I have a wide assortment of sunscreen, of various formulations and types. It is my #1 skin care product as I use it daily all year long. It is a habit. I avoid the sun for a few reasons, so sunscreen is vital to my well being. I live in a variable climate (from dry, freezing temps to humid hot) and I have sunscreen preference depending on season and situation. I tend to prefer mineral (my fair skin can handle any white cast) but do utilize chemical sunscreen often.<br /><br />I am going to like this for basic daily summer use. I tend to reduce my morning skin care routine down to a basic wash or splash of water and a moisturizing sunscreen. Since this offers SPF 50 (P++++), I know my skin is going to be pretty well protected. Since it feels like a moisturizer and goes on clear, I can skip my other skin care if I want. I tend to skip morning skin care in the summer because I am likely to just sweat it off anyway (I have a more involved night time routine to make up for it). So a sunscreen such as this is easy to use, makes my skin feel good, and easy to reapply throughout the day. I dont wear make up usually, but for sake of review I used it under a light foundation tint. Seems to play well- I didnt notice any rolling/pilling. I'll use it up. I have also used it over other skin care (hydrating toner, serum, light moisturizer) and it worked well on top of all that too.<br /><br />Not sure yet if it will be repurchase.

For the longest time my facial “sunscreen” was just to avoid the sun, stay in the shade. That is still my mantra, but occasionally when I know I’ll be in the sun I put on a good Asian sunscreen - because they tend to uncheck all the boxes of the things I mentioned above. That said, this is another sunscreen I am adding to my collection. It did not feel uncomfortable on my skin and did not leave any white cast or blotches.

Anything to get us out the door looking somewhat put together with the least amount of time involved is the goal.  If you're looking for a quick eyeshadow look that takes next to no time these are one answer.  Cream eyeshadow on one end and a brush on the other.  The brush is surprisingly usable, but since I've got older eyes (which means older skin that needs to be babied) I just use one of mine.  They go on pretty smooth and creamy.  Not a ton of pigment on the first pass, but it's very buildable.  The swatches on my arm are 2 passes of each color.  They also blend out really well.  I put a couple passes on my lower lid and blend it up into my crease and I'm good to go.  There is a bit of shimmer in this one, but it's not overwhelming.  Just a bit of sparkle that looks good even on aging eyes.  They make it through the whole day, but I did notice some creasing and breakdown after about 6-8 hours.  Not a lot, just enough to be noticeable.  Overall these were pretty impressive and I think they'd also be great for someone who was just getting into makeup too.",1

AH5PGJYVXBFVRXAFSTA7AEH4EXRQ,B08R6QX4Y9,4,2021-04-12 09:08:36.591,Pretty nice quality hair for the price.,"I've been using extensions since 2006, due to health issues causing extreme hair thinning.  I used to get the fused extensions at the salon, 1500 dollars back in the day. They broke off from the weight of the extensions because my hair was so fine and thin. The fused glob of hair was just too much and so many fell out. I started buying the clip in hair, taking the clips off and using them as weft hair. I use salon pro white glue, much like eyelash glue but used for weft hair.  It is a wonderful solution and I still alternate between tape in hair and the clip in wefts. I also buy closures and custom color, to make my own toppers. What a job! But, I'm happy with the results. I have more control over the color and style, and I feel 'normal'.<br /><br />This hair is a medium to coarse texture, thick, and has a really nice body wave. The  is soft and smooth and doesn't feel damaged.  It will blend with fine hair. You can use a straightening iron, just be sure that you can control the temperature. Once you burn this hair, it will stink and it will be ruined. However, if you control the temperature and use care, the hair looks great straight and shiny. You can also curl the hair. I have used felted hot rollers, and those work really well. They are safer, and not as damaging, and the curls last so long.<br /><br />These 16"" extensions are very nice. Although the ad isn't quite accurate. The color is a darker caramel blond, and a reddish brown. This is not piano keys, but close. The wefts are not in the ombre style, they are bold and varied high lights. If you look at the ad images, the photos showing the people aren't shown with this product in their hair. The wefts laying on a surface showing the color differences between the offered colors is the most accurate.  I've offered some images that show the color more accurately.  You can custom color most of the wefted hair, but adding color is easier. Typically the hair has so much red in it that it is impossible to cover or remove, and the dye can be hard to remove. You can add a longer root to eliminate the chunky roots.  My hair is so fine, the sewn edge can be obvious, so have a good match to my natural blonde ash tone roots helps. Any coloring will add to the damage and potentially shorten the life of the hair, but for me it makes me happier to have an exact match to what I want, and I am hard to match for color.<br /><br />The weight of the hair is shown in a photo in ounces. In grams, we get a little over 104 grams, far less than the advertised 120grams, and I would complain about this and have, just not for this brand.  That being said, the fullness and the weight is still good, and the wefts seem to feel average when compared to what I usually order. If you order the longer options, the hair will be thinner, as most hair is sold by weight. 120 would be better, of course. This weight is significantly lower than 120grams.<br /><br />Shedding.  Over the last 7 years or so, shedding has become a real problem. It never used to be this bad. There is a weft glue that is meant to slow or prevent shedding and I always use it. It makes the weft more stiff, but if you use the weft the way I use them, you need to do something to protect your weft hair.  You can find it online. If you are using this hair for special occasions and clipping  to thick strong hair and are simply making your hair more full, wild and glamorous, then you may not need to worry about shedding. I did finger comb this hair once out of the packaging, and there was significant shedding. Again, I say, this is a common issue now, and unique to this particular brand. I have no idea what changed but the wefts should not shed this much, but they all do this with most brands.  I have to say that if the wefts didn't shed so much, they would last for a couple of years or longer.  Also, keep in mind I use the wefts differently, so clipping, as intended, may offer longer life and far less shedding.<br /><br />The length is 16"" and the hair hangs nicely, with a gentle, natural taper.  There is a very nice body wave. It's not a blunt edge finish, which is nice.<br /><br />The clips are the same type that I see on most clip in kits. They are small, and hold nicely even on fine hair.<br /><br />Over all, I think this is a great value and will require the extra effort to keep them looking great over a year or more.  To keep human hair looking good and tangle free, I use the sleep and shine shampoo and conditioner. It keeps the hair fresher and mat free longer.  There are a lot  of youtube videos that can help you with application and care, and give you tips and tricks.<br /><br />4 stars.",1

This review is for: Nail Polish Gel Remover Tools Kit for Women with Nail Clip Caps, Nail File, Nail Remover Cotton Pads,Brush, 2-in-one Cuticle Scraper/Pusher.<br /><br />First things first, I was surprised to come here to write this review and discover that I received no dispenser bottle as listed and pictured in the product description. Since this kit does NOT come with the remover liquid,  you are going to have to buy some acetone. (In my state, you must be 21 to buy it.) Since this came with no bottle, I followed the directions on the acetone itself, and used a glass measuring cup in which to pour it. (This way if I didn't use it all, I could easily pour it back into the bottle. Note to self, buy another measuring cup!)<br /><br />With that out of the way, this kit worked as described. I used tweezers and soaked the little pads in acetone and then wrapped it around my nail and applied the clamp. I did this to all of my nails at once, because my husband was here to help me with the second hand. If you have no one to help you, then you're going to need to do each hand separately. It is impossible to do much with these clamps on your fingernails. Once the clamps are on, you need to wait at least 20 minutes before removing them, to soften up the polish.<br /><br />Once I removed the clamps I set to work scraping off the polish. It does NOT come right up like regular polish does, but if you've soaked them for 20 minutes, and you applied it in thin layers when you originally polished them, it's easy to scrape the rest of it off. Once you're done, your nails look pretty bad. It will be necessary to buff them out and then wash them and apply some moisturizing lotion because your nails and the tips of your fingers will be very, very dry.<br /><br />I have heard some real horror stories of people trying to get gel nails and gel nail polish off, but this kit made it much easier and alleviated my fears. Other than the missing dispenser bottle, I'm rather happy with this kit.",1

AEHWKRPNWNMOAJSMO2F6O7RFRTNA,B08TR1MKHD,5,2021-04-13 18:13:34.536,Easy to use,"Definitely worth having, it cleanses well and it doesn’t bother my sensitive skin. It has a good scent",1

AHEMJ62SUJPUYNWGROPI6MUAYQ5A,B081D8D5YV,5,2021-04-13 18:31:15.380,got them for my palm tree,"These are the same as epsom salts. They should not be used in gardens unless you need more magnesium. Too much is not a good thing, so all of the internet stuff recommending epsom salts are really bad advice. But, palm trees often need supplemental magnesium, so I got this. The effect takes time to show, so I am not going to lie and say my palms instantly look great, but this is a decent product and it should work just fine. But no, your tomatoes will not grow better if you add this.",1

It does smell nice without being overwhelmingly sweet/floral/oddly chemically synthetic...so its nice.  Your skin doesn't feel like a dried up piece of parchment paper after using and its clean so WIN WIN.,1
AGNGL5CYYEB5CZLIRD5F5XSX2H4A,B086ST4W1C,2,2021-04-13 22:53:19.996,Hard to remove and only use one coat or it will glue up on you.,"This had a super strong chemical smell. It looked nice with one coat. No thickness or volume but it lengthened ok. However it did dry super fast and adding a second coat was a terrible idea. It clumped into a sticky mess. One coat wasn't enough volume for me. It was hard to remove, I had to use castor oil. Pass on this one.",0
AGNGL5CYYEB5CZLIRD5F5XSX2H4A,B086SSMK7P,3,2021-04-13 22:57:50.585,"Nice length, but no volume.","With one coat, this looked pretty good. It gave pretty nice length. Not much volume. You can't do more than one coat though, cause it makes your lashes stick together really badly and you have to remove it and start again. It's super hard to remove, you need petroleum jelly, baby oil or olive oil. Something heavy duty. I need more volume and it was just messy to work with. It also smelled strongly of chemicals.",0
AGNGL5CYYEB5CZLIRD5F5XSX2H4A,B086SSHLWT,2,2021-04-13 23:29:34.475,Smelled bad. Don't use two coats.,"So this smelled strongly of chemicals. It was easy enough to remove with soap and water, then face cleanser. It didn't smudge overnight. One coat looked nice, gave decent length but no volume or thickness. Beware of the second coat. It will clump up and make your lashes stick together like glue. Awful. If you want a simple one coat mascara for everyday and can deal with the smell, this will be nice. But I can find better. And the smell turned my stomach. Kinda scared me.",0
AGN5KJZU3FYSKVWXWM66LXYWL5CQ,B07YL4485K,4,2021-04-14 00:35:52.689,Work great,My wife likes these rubber bands. Her hair is shorter so they work nicely to secure her hairstyles. They are very lightweight. They don’t stretch out too much either. It doesn’t pull her hair out or tangle her hair. The bag they came in is nice too. She loves these.,1
AGGD6CXA3JFPIPECTSBFB43YZQAA,B07Y2WSGVW,3,2021-04-14 00:47:43.388,"Very relaxing, all natural. Clinical but clean scent. Pricey for size!","On the fence on this product for one reason: price!! Don't get me wrong - I love a good bath and maybe I am crazy but I will pay up to $20 to my favorite retailer for their beautiful CBD bath bombs (which yes, also includes a crystal)  but as an avid bath salt user from basic to boutique; I cannot for the life of me understand what is in this product that justifies that price point. I compared to some of my premium brands too; just to see what this might have that they don't<br /><br />After a long spin class followed by 30 minutes of strength workouts I was feeling the muscle burn so I added this to my bath and soaked for 20 minutes. The smell is not my favorite but it is one I am used to from some of the other brands I use and it is consistent with the natural ingredients. It is hard to define but I would say it has an almost clinical smell.  It reminds me of a very clean hospital - not bad, just not my personal favorite scent. That said, they do use all natural ingredients so for that I am willing to pay more and I will say it was very relaxing, and helped with the muscle soreness.<br /><br />You do also get a rather large crystal in the bag -I like crystals but here is a watch out just in case you are not bothered one way or another - the crystal weighed 1oz so you are getting 8oz salts which is enough for one bath with 1/9 of the bag weight being taken up by the crystal.<br /><br />Now to be fair, the ingredient list does show all natural with no fillers that you might see in cheaper products such as coconut oil or unsourced scents and I really do feel crazy relaxed after this bath! Just wish it was maybe enough for 2/3 baths !!",0
AE23ZBUF2YVBQPH2NN6F5XSA3QYQ,B08S3B8Y5G,5,2021-04-14 01:36:13.630,Comes fully assembled!,"For once, this comes with everything already assembled AND comes with scrunchies!  Depending on what kind of hair ties you are using, this could hold anywhere from 8 scrunchies to 50 hair ties. It literally comes fully assembled, ready to be used right out of the box. The scrunchies are cute and functional! All the rage these days with youth. The only thing I notice that is different about this one than others is that it doesn't have the open cylinder at the top. Most of the others have an open top for bobbie pins and clips. However, that is not a negative as it literally is perfectly sized and comes with everything needed. And even better, it's the perfect less than $10 item for birthdays or gifts at $9.99 at the time of review.",1
