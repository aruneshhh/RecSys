AGV5NQ4JDQD6NHXVF6AVZPVDX66Q,B08SSXQSVX,5,2022-03-15 00:44:44.867,Refresh your Feet!,I'm very happy about its moisturizing effect. It's absorbed quickly so it doesn't make sheets or socks greasy. Nice subtle scent. Is very rich but easily absorbs into the skin without feeling too greasy. I use it just before bed and my feet feel soft and smooth the next morning.<br /><br />Hope you found this review helpful!,1
AFOKWZIJI7K6Z6R4T7SSXRTWZNOQ,B0BR4GL7Q6,1,2022-03-15 01:14:08.044,Smells like cooking oil. Leaves grease on face,I do not recommend this at all. It smells absolutely terrible. Leaves a thick greasy film on your skin that's hard to get off.  Smells like vegetable or olive oil.  More like something you'd cook with than put on your skin. Does remove the makeup but at the cost of smelling like a fry cook. Sorry but gross,0
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,B08N5NDVGH,3,2022-03-15 21:56:02.768,Light-weight cream that is a bit tacky to start; slightly moisturizing once absorbed; scentless,"This comes in a one gallon jug. There are two negatives to me. First, the biggest negative is that it takes work to dispense the lotion. Second, this lightweight lotion goes on tacky and takes a few minutes to absorb. Once absorbed, however, it is lightly moisturizing and it leaves my skin soft.<br /><br />This is vegan per the bottle and the lotion is scentless. My favorite lotion is [[ASIN:B09HYPWMKG Ginger Lily Farms Pure Morocco Argan Oil Butter Lotion]]. That is perfect for a massage as well. It has a fragrance and is cruelty-free but not vegan.<br /><br />This is decent but the initial tackiness I dislike. The current price of $54.99 for 128 ounces comes to $.43 per ounce, which is almost double the price of the lotion I love.",0

It takes my massages to the next level, by making my achy tense muscles a thing of the past. And it does an amazing job at restoring my best blood circulation.<br /><br />Plus, it’s supple enough to actually mend my dry skin, making it a multifunctional lotion of love. And the effects last an extended amount of time, thanks to its ability to provide quick absorption. This is the massage lotion I depend on for fast relief of my sore muscles!",1
AEPKAGO2WGVI55RQAVNBXKGJ2BOQ,B09QT8SLJB,5,2022-03-18 14:10:17.039,My favorite,"I've been buying AOA beauty blenders directly from their website for years. They're my favorite. They hold up very well thru many washings and blend my makeup beautifully. They get quite large when wet, so I can apply my foundation quickly and blend effortlessly. I highly recommend these beauty blenders.",1
AHSO54ZJ72XL244YJ55XAAJCYJCA,B09NVT7GGD,5,2022-03-18 14:34:13.212,Nice!,"I like this brush for my small, short-hair dog. It helps remove his loose hair and he seems to enjoy it when I brush him. I like that I can push a button and it pushes the hair to the ends of the bristles so that I can easily remove the hair. It doesn't get all of the hair, but it is a lot more effective than a normal brush. Overall,  I'm really happy with this brush and would get one like it again.",1

AHSO54ZJ72XL244YJ55XAAJCYJCA,B09QT8SLJB,5,2022-03-18 14:46:26.103,Great,"I like these blenders. They help blend my foundation much better than cotton pads or by just using my fingers. I prefer wearing make-up to look more natural, so I appreciate that these blenders help me put on my make-up so that lines, etc aren't noticeable. They seem to clean well, and I am enjoying using them as part of my daily routine.",1
AF6QHJSY6N5MMHTC5L26QOTX6K3Q,B09NVT7GGD,4,2022-03-19 17:42:41.617,The cute isn't a cover up...,"A good number of times when you see something as cute as this little bee-esque slicker brush, the manufacturer is covering up a shoddy product and hoping the ""awwww, it's SO CUUUUUUTE!!!!!"" factor will overwhelm the buyer so much they don't notice and/or care when the product gives up the ghost after only a few uses. So yes, choosing this slicker based on looks probably wasn't the smartest of choices, but in the end it seems to be a good one. This slicker brush is rather nice (and should be for the $20 price tag). It's comfortable to hold. There is weight to it so this doesn't feel flimsy to where the grooming head will break off if you try to comb out a snarl in your pet's fur, or like the body is the thinnest molded plastic they could get away with so it didn't break just removing it from the packaging. Another plus is the end of the tines are tipped/dipped in protective little drops of plastic so the sharp metal ends don't harm your pet. I've always avoided those slickers as they seem like some kind of torture device - how can bare metal ends be comfortable when raked over skin?<br /><br />For taking care of loose hair, this did a bang up job on our two Maine Coons, including the one who absolutely loathes - and I mean to the depths of H.E. double hockey sticks with a side of utter disgust  - being brushed. She was adopted from the shelter as an abused kitty from the home of an older cat hoarder, and whatever happened during her first six years of life there were traumatic enough that she will do her best to eviscerate anyone who tries to groom her long fur beyond the area of her neck. She actually lets us very gently use this on the rest of her back and legs and tail for around 45-60 seconds before flipping out, and that's a big improvement!  Who knows, maybe she's as amused by the itty bitty bee antenna as we are, but this is the first slicker brush (even with the safety tipped teeth) she's let us use on her back, sides, and legs. The other Maine Coon (a big chonker of a guy) lays on his back with his legs stretched out and purrs like a race car when he gets groomed, so it's not a surprise that he loves this slicker as well. Cleaning the hair out is easy. Just press the button, the plastic disk pushes up, and the hair is forced off of the tines for easy removal. A few of the finer hairs may stick to the plastic or around the tines, but nothing major. When the slicker gets dirty between the base and the underside of the plastic disk, one of those super skinny reusable straw scrubby brushes and a bit of dish soap does the trick. We clip a wooden clothespin on either side of the plastic disk to keep it raised so the tines can air dry and not rust from trapped moisture. Since the tines all seem to be securely anchored to the base of the slicker head, we aren't too concerned about one being pulled out while trying to work through a tangle. It's still a good idea to check the tines every so often to make sure they are all there, none are loose, and that none of the little safety tips at the end of the tines have come off.<br /><br />The only thing that could improve this slicker is a price reduction. A pair of googly eyes wouldn't hurt, either.",1

AENH6LSB6BM7XLPEYUL43WBOD6JA,B088G1ZJHP,5,2022-03-21 12:08:30.939,Expensive Machines,"The NuDerma wand has done a lot for my aging skin. There are a few creams and sera I swear by -> modern science is pretty cool. It used to be that anything topical just sat on your skin doing nothing (except the one with the french name and gazillion dollar price tag - which, btw, you can get much cheaper in the blue german tin plus seaweed serum). Anyhoo - enter the era of home treatments. Thermal machines are great if you have the money, and for less (but still not cheap) you can get these wands that are practically miraculous.<br /><br />Used correctly and alongside good skincare practices, they can clear acne, minimize lines, and restore an awful lot of tone and some volume to aging skin. They don't work for everyone, but my skin is thin from prednisone use and it's aging, and the NuDerma wand has been great at firming and plumping over time.<br /><br />Mine came with the red wands, and I wanted to try the blue on my kid's pizza face. Did I mention that these things zap you?<br /><br />Yeah, that's important. They zap you. You want to get some numbing cream. Anyway, he's never going to let me do this again, but it's too bad because it cleared his skin beautifully. And fast. And no giant pores from popping stuff. And because they are combination wands, I can use them on my skin.<br /><br />All for a very affordable amount.",1

The significant other says that she likes unicorn themed objects/products so she can share them with her friends' children, especially the daughters.  But, I know that the truth is she adores the fantasy equine character.  So, this headband with a unicorn motif was a no-brainer.<br />It is nicely designed, with excellent unicorn aspects, cute ears and fantastic horn.  Plus, the colorful, furry headbands are visually attractive with excellent materials, and quality craftsmanship.  The fluffy material feels great against the skin, and the stretch is perfect (her actual words).  The three headbands match the look and colors in the pictures in the product details.<br />Attached are photos to show real world images of the unicorn headbands, with a ruler for size reference. I provided images of the outside and inside of the band, plus side view, to show the quality construction.<br />Does it meet expectations? Well, I'm eating my dinner and she's sitting opposite me, wearing the light multi-colored headband.  So, I'm having dinner with a unicorn!<br />It fully meets expectations, earning a 4.75 - 5 star rating, with a very high level recommendation. (She insists it should get a full 5 stars, though.)",1

Or cleaning products for that matter....  It just brightens up my mood in a way that a floral scent can't do.  This lotion has a decent citrus smell to it with a touch of a sweet undertone.

I'm in need of a good hair cut! However, this straightener brush really made them look so much better, almost healthy! I used it with the steam feature and I don't think I've liked a straightener this much in a very long time.<br />I should probably mention something more about this device. This has a 30 second (to a minute) fast heating time, three different heat settings, a steam feature, an anti-scalding feature, and constant temperature protection. It also comes with a glove to protect your hand from the heat, a little water bottle thingy for the steam feature (I think), and a hair clip to use while straitening.<br />I really like this. Usually this type of thing takes me at minimum fifteen minutes or so. This took me about 7 to get a decent effect.<br />I recommend this if you are looking for a hair straightener that will give you a near salon look.",1

AHOYQ263ZGBZIBPQGKNVAWG35DNQ,B009GPP546,5,2022-03-31 17:16:53.639,"Silky Smooth, Smells Wonderful","I tried this specifically because of the name, but was prepared to be disappointed. ""Citrus Souffle"" sounds almost too good to be true.<br /><br />But it's not. First, the scent. I get migraines, and scents are a trigger. Citrus, eucalyptus, and peppermint are OK - perfumes or manufactured fragrances have become a big ""no"" for me. Since a side effect is an extra sensitive sense of smell (which means things I put on my face have to be tolerated), I gravitate towards those I can tolerate. Sometimes even scents I usually like go awry in plastic containers or in a specific cosmetic mix. But this citrus is lovely. Limes, oranges, lemons, all rolled into one. A veritable orchard from this single cream. Wonderful.<br /><br />And the cream? So light, silky smooth, and creamy. From trying other creams, I know that if there's any chance the product will be slow to absorb, that will happen with my skin. This cream was quick to absorb, not heavy or weighing down, and left my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and as velvety soft as the cream itself.<br /><br />I'm also delighted that this product complies with the Australian SafeCosmetics Toxic Free Campaign and is listed as a participating vendor.

Then you pull out the nice-sized brown glass bottle of oil which has a beautiful sophisticated minimalist label on it - the whole presentation is excellent.<br /><br />The bottle has a pump top and it's the style of pump that I hate because it's hard to control the amount of oil you're getting - it's a whole pump worth at a time or nothing. I much prefer glass droppers, I feel like I can dispense a more precise amount of oil that way. The directions say to use 8-10 pumps of oil to cleanse your face & neck, which seems EXCESSIVE. I can accomplish my oil cleanse with HALF that amount.<br /><br />The oil has no added scent, so it just smells like oil. Mine smells like good-quality oil with no sourness or rancidity.<br /><br />This oil is currently priced at $42 for the 3.4oz bottle - if you're using the full 8-10 pumps of oil per cleanse like the directions say, you're gonna burn through a LOT of expensive oil. It is certified USDA organic though, so if you use less and don't burn through it so fast I think it's a great cleansing oil with a great blend of skin-friendly ingredients.",1

I measured approximately 6 inches across the opening with a headband unstretched, and about 9 inches when fully stretched.

It Detoxifies, Moisturizes, Promotes Hair Growth and Make Your Strands Stronger. So, it's great for all hair types no matter what issues you have.<br /><br />What I like about this kind is that it doesn't have any tangle smell or smells bad in particular. It's very floral and fragrant, definitely would make your hair smell like it just had a wash.<br /><br />It comes in a spray bottle with two caps. (One regular cap and one spray cap) I can just change the caps so it doesn't leak when I store it, so that's a plus as well.<br /><br />It's easy to use. It's not super thick either, so it sprays well and has decent coverage. It also sinks in well and deeply, feels good in hair, and moisturizes pretty great.<br /><br />I don't have any complaints about it. It's good for your hair and feels great in it. Plus, it has many other great attributes such as Chemical Free, Preservative Free, Sulfate Free.<br /><br />Of course, growth is gonna take time, but I'm along for the ride.😁<br /><br />PS: No matter the nature, I only write honest, unbiased, and authentic reviews.",1

I can usually get the top pretty smooth but have some baby hairs and bad hair days where little hairs stick out and adding more of my regular lightweight gel or other products can weigh my hair down too much, make it look wet or dirty or make it clumpy or stiff. I don’t know why but I didn’t have high hopes that this Wing Fly Grl Mane Taming Wand gel would be anything special, but it really works great for my fine hair.<br /><br />It’s about the size of a mascara and has a wand with a small foam type applicator (similar to one on a lip gloss) at the end. I just gently run it over the hairs sticking up on top and they just lay down and blend right in with the rest of my hair.  I can’t say how this works for thick hair, but it sure is fast and easy to use and works great for me. My hair is very dark brown and I can’t see any sign of the gel, just the benefit of smooth hair.<br /><br />I haven’t experienced any flaking, dryness, stiffness, wet look, burning or discomfort or issues with my hair color. This wand is convenient as it’s so compact and easy to carry in my purse on-the-go. The ingredient list is short and no ingredients stand out as worrisome health risks or as being possibly damaging to my hair. It works like a charm smoothing my little flyaways and so far has no negative consequences. I’ll update if I see any issues in the longer term, but it’s all good so far.

The flavors are very popular fragrances of strawberry, grape, and bubblegum. The strawberry and the grape do appear to be slightly tinted, but you will not notice any real color added to your lips from them. You can use them alone and enjoy just a nice clear gloss over your natural color lips, or you can put it over top of your color and no worry of changing the color of your favorite lipstick. It will add a very nice bit of shine and a little bit of a sparkle to whatever color you decide to slide it over.  I do not notice a lot of flavor to these glosses, but the color is very pretty. I feel that the box is a nice addition if you plan on giving these as a gift. I think this would make a wonderful gift for a young girl or even an older lady. I can’t imagine anybody that wouldn’t enjoy receiving this trio of lip glosses. I felt the price was extremely fair and that the quality of this item was very good.",1
AH3OJBOMJC4VDM7H3WPKDYMOXWNA,B08V8JDTLM,4,2022-04-17 01:39:26.910,IPL hair removal tool adds active cooling (ICE). Relative low-power (36W),"The market for IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) devices for hair removal has exploded in the past couple of years, and you'll find a myriad of options on Amazon.<br /><br />I've tried a large number of these IPL devices at this point, and I can say that these IPL devices all work pretty similarly, with only a few differences separating them. If you are looking for hair removal, then the most significant differences mostly amount to ergonomics (shape of the device and positions of the buttons) and whether it integrates ""ICE"" functionality to actively cool the region to which you're applying the light.<br /><br />This is a mid-priced unit that adds ICE Cooling functionality and works reasonably well.<br /><br />Specifics of this IPL device:<br /><br />** Only performs hair removal<br />** Includes ICE skin cooling functionality<br />** LCD screen shows the number of flashes left and power level (1-5), plus whether ICE auto modes are on/off<br />** Rated for 36W (low end of power for a home IPL)<br />** Oblong shape<br />** Rated for 999,999 flashes<br /><br />Operation is pretty trivial:<br /><br />1) Attach the power cord to the IPL device (the device is NOT battery operated--you must have it plugged in).<br />2) Turn on the device via the power button, which is a button in the middle of the top of the device.<br />3) Choose the power level to use (you have five levels, and you cycle through them using short pushes of the power button). The level will be indicated on the LCD screen.<br />4) Place the front end of the device against the skin you are trying to treat and push the flash button (big button on the top of the IPL). There is a ~1s  refractory period after flashing before you can flash again.<br />5) Ice technology, which actively cools the metal region that comes in contact with your skin.<br /><br />The light is extremely powerful and could damage your eyes with continued direct exposure. Therefore, you should never look directly into the light and a cheap pair of folding protective eyeglasses are included in the box. The light is triggered by sensors in the front of the device. Using very slow-motion photography, I was able to capture a ~1/100th split-second snapshot of the light (see photos). But the light duration is extremely short.<br /><br />You run the tool over the area where you want to remove hair and make sure you expose all the hair follicles in that region. You will not see any immediate results. The light signals your hair to stop growing, but it requires multiple treatments over several weeks before you will be expected to see results. Eventually, you should find a substantial reduction in the hair in the treated areas.<br /><br />In the box, you get the tool, a power cord, a pair of eye protection glasses, a cheap disposable razor, plus instructions.<br /><br />A word about the ""ice"" functionality, because this listing provides almost no detail (nor do those for other IPL devices):<br /><br />Ice functionality is another term for ""Local epidermal cooling.""<br /><br />This is given various names in listings, one of the most common is ""ice function"" or ""ice-cooling"". This is local cooling of the epidermal region (surface skin) in the region where the IPL light pulse is being applied. The high-powered light can be irritating to some people, and cooling the skin in that region can reduce the immediate irritation. (It does not improve/decrease the efficacy of the treatment). This cooling effect is achieved via a Peltier junction semiconductor and a good thermoconducting material at the head of the IPL device (frequently sapphire or aluminum) that transmits the cold that the semiconductor generates to the skin. (A heatsink and fan inside the IPL device remove the heat that the Peltier junction also produces).<br /><br />Epidermal cooling is not required for efficient use, but it may make it less unpleasant to use the device for some users.<br /><br />This IPL device is lower-mid-priced relative to other IPL devices on Amazon, but it does add the ""ICE"" cooling functionality. The rated power is 36W, which is on the low end of the range of power you typically see for these home IPL devices (between 30W and 60W).<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Pros:<br />** Integrates epidermal cooling (ICE)<br />** LCD readout<br /><br />Cons:<br />** Not the cheapest IPL device you can buy<br />** 36W rating is at the lower end for these types of devices",1

I usually just use sugar scrubs as they’re gentle and they smell great. However, with this scrub - it’s very rough. I absolutely wasn’t expecting to be so rough. I had gotten a decent amount on my wash cloth and rubbed it on my leg and immediately noticed that it was causing like little micro scratches. The salt flakes are really coarse and uncomfortable to rub against the skin. It’s suppose to exfoliate not rub off the skin. Like goodness. I started using it on my calloused feet and it didn’t really hurt and made a little bit of a difference. But as for like legs, arms and things like that? I definitely wouldn’t use it on those places. It also leaves a thick film/residue. Much too oily in my opinion. It does smell nice though but overall, I’m just not impressed unfortunately. Maybe if the salt flakes were a lot more fine and not so much oil but otherwise, I wouldn’t recommend. Also, it’s price tag is a bit high for a smaller jar.",0

I was worried the teeth would be too far apart, they're not. What is surprising is that this even works on my short haired cats. It pulls out loose fur just fine & my cats enjoy the way it feels. It does pull my long haired cats fur. She doesn't put up a fuss. Just purrs, cries at me if it hurts & continues to purr & reaches for me when I stop.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of getting away from plastics whenever possible. The comb is attractive & looks nice left out on my coffee table. The downside is that the handle is very thin & is pretty short. I have very small fine boned hands (I'm a wee Irish lass) & need to have my fingers at the comb for comfort & control. If you have large hands, I'm not sure this will work. Also, because it's not ergonomic it's really only good for short periods of use esp. if you have carpel tunnel like I do.<br /><br />In summary, I like the comb even though the quality could be better. A wider, longer more comfortable handle made with a stronger wood would have been pawsome. But for a casual grab to comb a visiting fur baby while I'm on the couch - it's purrfect!<br /><br />Made in China.",1

These are glass bottles but instead of the annoying dropper cap, these serums are a gel-like consistency that is pumped out instead. No dripping serums wasted. It does have a bland scent which I'm not too crazy about but that's just from smelling it from the bottle. I can't smell it when it's on my face which is good. The serums all absorb quickly into my skin and they don't feel greasy. I haven't experienced any adverse skin reaction. After application I can see my skin glowing, when I first used it my skin became a little pink but it went away quickly. It was probably just my skin adjusting to the retinol and it doesn't happen anymore since I've been using it for a few nights now. I'm pretty happy with this set and it's reasonably priced if you're just starting to venture into the anti-aging skin care regimen.",1

I like the variety of stencils included. It was easy to position and hold one in place. The problem was with the pencil...every time you try to color your eyebrow, the tip just rolls back into the tube after each pass over, making it annoying to have to keep holding the stencil with one hand while constantly twisting the color back out of the applicator with the other!

I didn’t use the whole stencil because most of them would create a pretty large brown but I use them to create the shape and make them both uniform. You pick a stencil then do one side then flip the stencil to do the other stencil.<br /><br />Works pretty well but you will probably need to do some of your creativity to make them look more natural.<br /><br />Over all these are pretty helpful especially when you have the need to draw on brows daily, it speeds of the process and makes sure your aren’t leaving the house with 2 totally different brows.🤨",1

I can tell it doesn't hurt my cat...although she still doesn't love what's happening. It smoothed their hair without pulling it all out. The bristles kept their shape. The button pushed all the hair up, so I could cleanly and easily pull it all off. It's more comfortable to hold, and the cover is actually helpful to keep the bristles clean and protected from being bent. It's a little large for even my large cats but totally doable.

You still feel heat from it though, but the cooling effect of the front plate mitigates it to a fair extent.<br /><br />In terms of effectiveness, I found that this slowed down or thinned hair growth after about three weeks of use. It's important to follow the instructions though as you have to have hair down first. It won't work if there is visible hair growth. The area of effect is a narrow band so it's not ideal for legs. It mainly works well for facial hair or small areas. Also, since laser treatment only works during active hair growth, it's necessary to keep treating repeatedly so that you hit a hair growth cycle.<br /><br />There is a disposable razor and a pair of wrap around sunglasses included to help you with the treatment. The sunglasses are pretty good, but I still closed my eyes and shielded the top of the laser treatment gun with my hand when using it as the flashes are fairly bright and visible even with eyes closed and sunglasses on.

I will note though, that if you're not used to using retinol, do your research and use it sparingly. It definitely can cause your skin to be dry and flaky at first. I only use it every 3 days or so with this regime and make sure to use moisturizer after I finish applying the serums. I use these serums at night and wash my face gently in the morning and I also use sunscreen if I go out after using retinol as it can cause sunburn. Overall, the benefits of retinol and all of these serums are extremely positive.",1

I'm glad I did! This is a significant improvement! I wanted to wait several weeks to write my review to see if there were results and after 6-7 weeks of use I'm definitely seeing a significant reduction in hair! The device is super easy to use and instead of having to manually select the correct level of power for your skin tone, the device analyzes your skin tone and makes the selection for you. It literally could not be easier. There's little to no irritation if you use it correctly. If I get lazy and try to use it with any sort of stubble, then it stings a bit. But if I shave prior to use then it's quite comfortable. It's absolutely worlds better than epilating for sure. But that's a different story for a different day. (Ouch.) The one thing that's a little tricky about using this device is that you're not supposed to overlap the rectangle of light, but there's really no way to see exactly where you're placing it because it's up against your skin. Other than that, this is a breeze to use. In the 6-7 weeks I've been using it I've seen probably a 40-50% reduction in hair growth and what is growing is lighter and more fine. I don't expect to be completely hair free even after the 12 week treatment program, but even a significant reduction in hair would be fantastic! Bring on the shorts and tank tops!",1

Doesn’t creases. Doesn’t flakes. Stays put all day but easy to remove with makeup wipes. Perfect for on the go and travel since it’s a good sized item. You get quite a bit of product which makes it worth it for the price especially since it’s such a good formula. It’s perfect for any time use.

Once I removed them, my skin feels fresh. The following morning, I feel my face moisturized and soft. There is enough serum to apply on the neck and chest area. There is no need to rinse after using them. Great option to use after a facial. It covers pretty well all face. I had to fold the nose area because of a recent nose ring, but it does cover the nose as well.<br /><br />Regarding the ingredients, I use skincare ingredient analyzers that follow the EWG, which individually rates ingredients from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest hazard). I was impressed to see all ingredients are rated EWG1. Another interesting fact around ingredients is that there are no parabens, sulfates, silicones, alcohols, allergens and fragrances (a very common ingredient that is highly hazard).<br /><br />Expiration date: 2025 (3 years after received)",1

The box I received said “medium” and it works for her, though it’s a little tight. There are a lot of silicone bristles inside and while that’s good for cleaning, if you’re on the borderline of it fitting your dog, too many bristles make it difficult to get your dog’s paws in and out and to agitate the cup enough to clean. I didn’t see a size noted when I ordered, so I’m not quite sure if it’s possible to order different sizes since I don’t see that info on the Amazon page, just on the box I received.<br />Cleaning the cup is easy - just rinse if the water isn’t too dirty or unscrew the top and remove the silicone bristle insert for a deeper clean.<br />The included towel is nice and fluffy, but only the size of a standard washcloth.

I usually spray some bleach cleaner in my tub and use a brush to scrub.  I applied a thin layer on my grout, which was not gross but needed to be cleaned.  I left it on for an hour and then tried to rinse it off with the shower.  It would not rinse off unless I scrubbed it.  Even when I used a brush I could still see a thin layer of the gel on my tiles.  This made me very nervous as the box says that if you touch the gel you should monitor yourself for sickness.  There were no instructions on the box to tell you how long to leave the gel on.  I left it on for about an hour and when I attempted to rinse/brush it off, there was very little difference than when I had started.  I would not use this again.",0

I get getting maybe an off-white colored cream but what I got was like a blue grey instead of the white in the listing. This would have made me question the integrity of the product because it didn't come with a safety seal or inner cap like most beauty products have nowadays. But I think that is the norm for this brand product because I tried one other product by this brand in the same type of packaging and that also did not have any type of safety seal. So for that I guess there is no issue to the product integrity. The consistency of the gel cream is pretty much the way that they describe it, it's thickness is like that of a cream but does feel cooling like a gel. I had applied it while my face was still slightly damp after a shower so it didn't absorb too quickly due to the moisture already on my skin. It did feel soothing once I smooth it all over my skin. It had a fresh clean scent to it and it did not irritate my skin. But once it dried and fully absorbed into my skin, I still felt like my skin was a little bit tight and still needed extra moisture. So I did end up adding another layer of facial moisturizer of a different brand that I normally use. Although my skin did feel soft and smooth after this product had dried, it just did not feel like it was fully moisturized. So I'm not really crazy about this product as I would probably not recommend it for someone who has very dry skin.",0

This doesn’t have a lot of ingredients and lacks chemical fragrance, but I find the scent is moderately strong. I assume it’s mostly from natural lavender, rose and grapefruit oils. I really don’t love the scent as it smells odd to me, but it mellows out and doesn’t really bother me. The lavender and grapefruit oils are potential irritants, but my sensitive skin hasn’t had any visible reaction or real discomfort using this primer.<br /><br />I have dry skin and when I apply the primer my skin feels a weird initial sensation that reminds me of alcohol, but so far it hasn’t caused any visible dryness. I do always apply a hydrating essence, serum and cream before the primer and I see the primer has glycerin, so that may be why I don’t see dryness or maybe something in this just feels mildly irritating to my skin. This does have benzyl alcohol pretty low on the list, so maybe I’m feeling that but the good part is that I haven’t had any real issue. I can’t say if daily use might dry my skin.<br /><br />This primer is super lightweight, so sheer it’s invisible and I don’t feel any sticky residue. It makes my skin feel silky, and my cream and liquid foundations spread smoothly and evenly over it. I do notice a blurring effect, especially around my mouth area where I need all the help I can get. My makeup holds up well all day even though the weather has been so really hot lately.

The inflatable guitar gives a whole new meaning to the term air guitar. With this you can play Bohemian Rhapsody! “NOT” Long live, Queen.<br />“Wayne's World"" was originally a recurring sketch from the NBC television series Saturday Night Live. It evolved from a segment titled ""Wayne's Power Minute"" (1987) on the CBC Television series It's Only Rock & Roll, as the main character first appeared in that show. A prototype of the Wayne character had appeared several years prior on CITY-TV in Toronto's overnight show City Limits. The Saturday Night Live sketch spawned a hit 1992 film, its 1993 sequel, and several catchphrases which have since entered the pop-culture lexicon. The sketch centered on a local public-access television program in Aurora, Illinois, hosted by Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers, the same actor from ""Wayne's Power Minute""), an enthusiastic and sardonic long-haired metalhead, and his timid and sometimes high-strung, yet equally metal-loving sidekick and best friend, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Wayne lives with his parents and broadcasts his show ""live"" from the basement of their house every Friday evening at 10:30. The first ""Wayne's World"" sketch appeared in the 13th Saturday Night Live episode of the 1988/1989 season. The only thing I didn't like about the Cap is that it clearly looks like a woven Cap on the ad, but the Cap that I was sent is definitely a screen print which I guess is, OK?  ” NOT”.

It is talc free, cruelty free, and vegan.<br /><br />This has a very simple ingredient list - Corn starch modified, distarch phosphate, silica. I liked that.<br /><br />It comes in simple packaging - It says it is sustainable packaging. It is an amber colored glass bottom (at least it seems like glass). It is thick, so seems durable. The top seems like tin. Mine was dented when I got it. Not sure how but it just came that way. The top twists off. Inside there is a plastic piece with 4 holes in it. There’s a sticker covering the holes that you remove. I like that it only has 4 holes. Loose powders can be so messy and I store mine in a drawer, but sometimes they get knocked over in the drawer and the powder goes into the cap and when I remove the cap I have to be careful not to get it everywhere. Because of that, I’ll usually only uncover like 3 of the holes on a loose powder. It means less powder getting out into the cap if it tips over. But, with this only having 4 holes I didn’t feel the need to do that.<br /><br />The powder is finely milled. It feels silky and smooth. It is white. It goes on mostly transparent. I’m really pale and was surprised that this made me look a little paler when I first applied it. I ended up going over where I applied the powder with a clean brush to get any excess off and that removed the pale look. So, the next time I used it, I used a damp sponge. I picked some up on the sponge, dabbed it off on the back of my hand to spread out the powder and get off excess, and then pressed it into my skin. That worked much better. It left my makeup set and smooth, without looking pale at all. It doesn’t feel or look dry or cakey. It gives a nice smooth, matte finish to the skin, but not too matte. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. So, I only powder where I have to. This doesn’t make my dry areas look or feel any drier and doesn’t accentuate them either.<br /><br />Overall, I really like this powder. It keeps my makeup looking nice all day. I don’t have breakthrough sweat or oils coming through it. I work 12 hour shifts and I’m on my feet running around for a lot of that time, so I often sweat. A lot of powders I’ll end up sweating through and needing to touch up throughout the day. I didn’t feel the need to do that with this. I really like it a lot. When I first saw how pale it made me after applying it the first time, I thought I was going to end up hating this. But, I’m glad I dusted off the excess and tried a different way of applying it the next time. Both ways work, but the damp sponge definitely is the best way I found for me. If you’re looking for a really nice powder, I’d recommend this!",1

I don’t wear foundation during the summer, only bronzer/blush and highlighter. My skin gets extremely oily and shiny by the end of the day. I put my bronzer and highlighter on and then applied this powder using a powder brush. I would only use the applicator inclosed with it if I had no other choice. I went out in my yard and watered all of my flowers, it was 80 degrees out so quite warm. Came back inside and looked in the mirror and my face was still matte. Went about the rest of my day which included a 2.5 mile walk with my family. When I went to wash the makeup off my face my nose was only slightly shiny, that’s it. I deducted a star because my skin gets pretty bronzed this time of year, it seemed like the powder washed my color out a little bit. It wasn’t a huge difference but enough to notice.",1

They supposedly hold 500 sprays.<br />(3) if you love Disney, these are cute as can be!<br /><br />But there are two things I don’t like so much:<br />(1) the cost. If you really get 500 sprays out of each bottle, maybe that’s not a bad value on a per use basis— but about $50 for 4 of these is more money than a lot of people have to spend on hand sanitizer.<br />(2) I can’t see any way to refill them. Most purse size hand sanitizers can be refilled—even though you wouldn’t get the same great smelling original product.<br /><br />Overall, these are certainly wonderful products and I LOVE them!

Easy to apply-a little goes a long way. Absorption is fast and does not leave a greasy/stick feel behind.  Instantly hydrates and soothes the red patches of inflammation that plagues my skin.<br /><br />The cream itself if a light blue-ish/grey-ish color but don't worry, it doesn't discolor skin. There is a  bit of a scent that I find to be medicinal though it fades quickly.<br /><br />I do not know if it occurred during shipping (the product shifted) or if its normal but my jar seemed to be missing some cream (see photo).

AGNMJIU3VXBRQMQG6JJQYPQBI2ZQ,B094771J4S,3,2022-06-11 19:27:54.908,Good so far,"Love the convenience of this pen, just wish the gel would come out a better way. First off, it took FIVEver to expression the gel out. I think I clicked the bottom 50 times before a tiny bead of gel started to appear, I had to aggressively click and slam the pen onto the counter to get more product out. Once I was finally able to get enough product out, I dried my teeth (after flossing and brushing first) and wiped the silicone bristles onto my teeth from premolar to  premolar on my upper and lower teeth, I used the box it came in to fan and dry off my teeth. I did this before bed time so I wouldn’t have the urge to eat or drink after. The gel will become stringy once your inner lips and cheek touch the gel and there’s a mild taste to it.  So far I’ve used this pen nightly for 4 days and I’ve seen a tiny bit of results. You’re supposed to use it twice a day for 2 weeks. I haven’t experienced any sensitivity from the gel, partly because I’ll use sensodyne toothpaste to brush and the gel is formulated with potassium nitrate that helps prevent sensitivity. Other good ingredients include xylitol and natural antioxidants. Overall good product, just need a better way to get the product out without having to click it. Twisting would be a better option and maybe transparent packaging so you know how much product is left.",0

These do give a pretty decent effect although takes a little practice to get them on.<br /><br />Cons - I didn't feel they stayed on as well as magnetic lashes do. I wore them for an hour show and they barely stayed. When I removed them there was no way that I would be able to use them again. They just weren't sticky enough.<br /><br />Overall - might be OK for teens, or people that don't do well with magnetic liner oe eyelash glue but for me they weren't secure enough.

You spray the back of the mask with water (a spritzer is included) and warm it up. It creates a moist compress for your eyes which is very soothing. There are also fragrance-infused inserts that you can use (or not) to create an aromatherapy experience. I think they can be refreshed with essential oils when they wear out in the future since they fit inside the mask and don't come into direct contact with your eyes, but I'd only use oils that are safe for direct contact with skin anyway.<br /><br />This can get pretty warm, but it takes quite a bit of time to warm up so I'd suggest plugging it in and turning it to the highest setting about 10 minutes before using it. After it's warmed up, then I turn it to the desired temperature. The controls are easy to use and intuitive. The only negative point is that the mask has to be tethered to a USB power source while you're using it which makes it harder to lie down while using it unless you have a power supply near at hand. The wiring is also on the fragile-looking/feeling side, but, so far, mine is working fine.<br /><br />The mask is soft and comfortable. The material is satin-like and rests directly on your eyes. The pressure can be adjusted using the strap, but depending on the shape of your face, it'll rest more or less directly. Until I got used to it, the pressure on my eyelids felt a little strange, but I adjusted and now it is fine. I also think this helped a bit with sinus pain by applying warmth to certain parts of my face.",1

It allows for you to get to the corners and edges where the mold builds up and it's hard to scrub unless you have a thin brush to work with.<br /><br />The gel is clear and you squeeze the bottle for it to come out. It's pretty much the gel sitting on top of a molded sealant in my showers that is supposed to slowly kill the mold and you remove it by wiping it down a few hours later. The gel clumps and it stays there. I have seen it work slowly but it does not remove much of the built up mold.,0

In real life it looks runny and sticky, but is surprisingly easy to work with.  After applying a long bead of the gel with the included brush, I pushed the gel to my desired shape, and then let it self level to smooth itself out.  On both thick and thin layers very little effort was required on my part.  In fact, if I tried to get the shape perfect with the brush, the gel got stickier and messier, so I quickly learned to let the gel smooth itself out.  Tip: once you get your shape all smoothed out, turn your nail upside down and let gravity create a natural apex before popping it under the lamp. So far I’ve only used the clear gel.  I created on extension (not shown), attached rhinestones to several pride nails, and fully encapsulated a fully covered rhinestone nail.  1 thick layer of this hard gel and a have encased rhinestones that fully cured in just over 2 minutes!  I also plan to use this for simple overlays when my nail need additional support.  The sticker nail forms work well, the slip solution is good for clean up work (not shaping the gel), and the brush/spatula tool work as expected.  The tiny buffer and file are silly...why include tools that won’t last a day?  Best off all, the gel containers are pretty big... these will last me awhile!",1

Mostly what I don't care for this brush vs Doodles is the handle. It is a little more narrow so it's a teensy bit less comfortable to hold. I have carpel tunnel. I've been grooming cats furever & grooming English angora rabbits for well over a decade.<br /><br />🐱For short & long haired cats, this brush works great. All of my cats love this brush & my Doodles brand. I can comb all of them except for my 14yo with a surprising amount of pressure & they roll around purring. Tons of hair gets picked up into the tines. Unlike some styles of brushes & combs, no hair is left behind around the tail area.<br /><br />Removing the hair from the brush is very easy. Start at one side from the bottom to loosen & then move to the other side. Keep working your way around & it comes off in a nice clean loose mat. I actually prefer these types of slicker brushes over self cleaning brushes & also over brushes with the little plastic beads on the ends. If you groom your animal properly, you don't need little balls on the ends of the tines. Those balls also make it a little harder to get the brush fully clean of hair.<br /><br />Cosmetically, I like the look of the brush much better than my Doodles brush. This is all black with a more classy branding in small white text on the head. We Love Doodles is blue & loudly brands itself on the head.<br /><br />🐰I don't recommend this style of brush for English angora rabbits. I have found that my bunnies seem to be more comfortable with smaller slickers with shorter tines. You'd think with their dense long coats, you'd want something large with long tines, but it really doesn't work out like you'd expect. At least for me it doesn't.<br /><br />🐰Recommended for English Angora Rabbits:<br /><br />🐇Doggy Man sells a small soft slicker brush that my angora rabbits love. It's plastic with a little blue ring on the handle. I have purchased/replaced many of them over the years (the handles tend to break over time) because they work well.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLVFH2<br />🐇I also recommend if money allows, a small slicker brush by Chris Christensen. I've never needed to replace it.<br />🌐 https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GU7NKWW<br /><br />Personally, I'd shop between this brand (Rita's), We Love Doodles, & Chris Christensen. Chris Christensen is top of the line. They are worth it if you have the money. We Love Doodles has been the middle ground for me. They were originally priced at $50, but the price has been a lot lower for a while now. Rita's is currently the second most expensive & probably the lowest quality of the three brands. However, I've been using it for the least amount of time, so it's too early to know for sure. So far I like all three.<br /><br />Chris Christensen: Made in Germany $75.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product//B00KAJTPZ2<br /><br />We Love Doodles: Made in USA $29.99<br />https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B09G981NXV<br /><br />Rita's: Made in China $36.99",1

The Essence is light with a gel like texture. It has no scent and doesn't dry out my skin. I use several pumps and tap it on a newly cleansed face.  It hydrates without causing any redness, irritation or sensitivity.<br /><br />After the essence, I use the Itfer Emulsion.  The Emulsion has a light citrus scent and shares the light gel texture. The Emulsion is easily absorbed into the skin without a sticky or oily feel.  It leaves the skin feeling hydrated.",1

When you apply the gel, you let it dry for 30 seconds, and they you can't drink or eat for 30 minutes. I would use this before bed, before working out, or after dinner while watching TV.<br /><br />By the third application I could tell a big difference in the whiteness of my teeth.

They are vegan and cruelty free. They are made in the USA. I included the ingredients at the end of my review.<br /><br />You get 3 glosses - a peachy pink toned one that has a strawberry scent/flavor, a more reddish toned one that has a grape scent/flavor, and a clear one that has a bubble gum scent/flavor. As for the scents, I can notice them when applying, not so much after the fact. I don’t really notice a taste really with any of them, but the ingredients do list “flavor” not fragrance/parfum, so it made me think they’d have more taste to them. Not a big deal to me though.<br /><br />While 2 of them are tinted in color, the color doesn’t really translate onto the lips. They just look clear on the lips. They don’t change any color of lip liner, lipstick, matte lip, etc. that I put them over top of. So, I liked that.<br /><br />The formula is nice. It feels nice and moisturizing on the lips, which I expected given they have nice moisturizing ingredients like Shea butter, coconut oil, and squalane. They do feel SLIGHTLY sticky on the lips. I hate sticky glosses, but these aren’t overly sticky. They don’t feel thick or heavy on the lips. They feel nice and thin. They are glosses so they do need re-applied often throughout the day. But, I’m used to that with glosses so it’s not a big deal to me.<br /><br />The strawberry and grape both have micro glitter in them (mica). I didn’t know that when I got these. None of the product photos showed they had glitter and the description didn’t say it either. I’m not a fan of micro glitter in my lip glosses. I feel once the gloss wears off, it usually leaves behind glitter particles on my lips. Also, they can sometimes feel gritty. So, I was surprised when I saw 2 of the 3 had glitter. Luckily, these didn’t feel gritty. I do notice that there are some glitter particles on my lips after they wear off, but it’s not too bad. The glitter particles are really small, so it’s not really noticeable. So, I don’t mind that.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice glosses with a nice formula. They might seem pricey when seeing the $30 price tag, but you’re getting 3 tubes of glosses, so that’s only $10 a piece, which isn’t bad. Of course, it isn’t great. You can get a tube of gloss that looks great and works just as well from the drugstore for slightly less. But, the ingredients might make it worth it to spend the little more. I give them 4 stars.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Bubblegum Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Grape Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 33 (CI#17200), CI 15850 (Red 7), Iron Oxides (CI 77499).<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique.<br /><br />Strawberry Lip Glossy:<br />Hydrogenated Polyisobutene, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil*, Isododecane, Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene Copolymer, Flavor, Sorbitan Oleate, Squalane, Butylene/Ethylene/Styrene Copolymer, Tocopherol, Titanium Dioxide, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter Extract, Calcium Aluminum Borosilicate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Mica, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E Acetate), Iron Oxides (CI 77492), Red 27 Lake (CI 45410), Silica, Tin Oxide.<br /><br />*Organic/Biologique",1

With this, you can see the glitter speck here, the glitter speck there, the glitter speck falling a little outside your lip line that will probably end up somewhere else on your face. It has more of a youthful, party feel. I agree it's a color reminiscent of sunsets, suited for summer and fall. The case is possibly the most sophisticated I own though.

There is an adjustable band at the back with minimal adjusment but it was enough to fit it securly.  The style is perfect and ready to go and needed next to no effort to make it look natural.<br /><br />Comfort - Fit well  and would easily be wearable all day.

I’ve paid $5 for one filled dispenser, with a generic scent one time, and i still thought that was a great thing to have. With this pack of 8 different scents, for less than $16, you’re getting a package for less than $2.<br />To say they are handy is an understatement. They are a Godsend. I don’t know how often I’ve gone into a bathroom, and the soap dispenser is empty. I was recently camping, and their soap dispenser in the toilets was empty during our whole stay. One thoughtful camper, left a bar of soap in a clear plastic cup, but it was a bit grimy with hairs on it, and i didn’t want to use that. With these handy pocket, or purse sized dispensers, you have a fresh sheet of soap each time. And they lather up very easily, as soon as they get wet.<br />They are small enough to put into the smallest purse, even your wallet, or pocket, and you’ll never be caught it out the ability to wash your hands.<br />These will last a while, as I’m not planning on giving any away. I might offer a sheet here and there, but not a whole dispenser for goodness sake. I’ll tell them where they can get their own.<br />I’m currently using the Tea Tree and it’s very fresh. I do feel very clean after using these, and will continue to recommend them to my friends.<br />Great value pack.",1

Honestly, I just couldn't achieve a mirrored chrome effect.  This set of powders, however, is amazing!  With almost no effort at all, I created 4 test nails, with the mirror effect coming through on all of them!  I used white at the base color on all my test nails, except for the gold nail that uses a nude base color.  These powders are super easy to use, a tiny amount goes a long ways, and the colors are just lovely.  A few tricks I discovered:  less powder is better than more...if you use to much it get's clumpy and can't be easily fixed.  Apply a base coat, a colored base color, AND a top coat before adding the chrome...this creates a wonderfully smooth and durable surface for the powder.  Be sure to brush the nails off to remove any loose powder before adding your final top coat.  I'm excited to use this powder on my own nails!!",1

That being said, it’s important that you suction off your hair in order to get the most effective results from using your hot tools. This also comes into play when you are trimming or cutting hair, as you cannot cut the entire thickness of a section with one pass. It is important that you suction off your hair into thinner bundles so that a hot tool or your hair shears are most effective in trimming or curling or straightening your hair. These suctioning clips are incredibly effective for two reasons. First, the bottom portion of the clip has a somewhat pointed, though rounded, edge to help divide the hair into sections. Second, the top portion of the lab has a padded layer that helps to grab onto and hold the suction of hair in place. With the Number of clips in this package, you have more than enough to work with in order to section of all areas of your hair for curling, straightening, or trimming. I absolutely love these clips already and am incredibly excited that they have helped to cut down the styling time it takes to straighten or curl my hair.

That being said, it is difficult and dangerous when it comes to hair loss to try to brush through or comb through your hair when it is wet. This wide tooth comb allows you to easily work from the ends up to the route with short brushstrokes to de-tangle your hair while eliminating, or at least reducing dramatically, any hair loss. Normal brushes will pull hair out or break hair off while trying to do this with wet hair. This brush comb works like the wet brushes by utilizing wide and widely separated teeth to separate the hairs in the tangles. I have found the using a wide tooth comb similar to this, and now using this, removing tangles is easy with the added bonus of helping to pull the conditioner through my hair more evenly, allowing the product to more effectively reach all of my hair for added softness and prevention of tangles going forward.

It looks sparkly and shimmery and has become a favorite for evening as it’s more glam than my subtle everyday pinks, yet it doesn’t look overdone or too intense. I wouldn’t normally choose an orange shade, but this turned out to be really flattering with my light skin with an olive hue. While “burnt orange” is a fair description of how it looks in the tube, on me this looks less orange and more like a reddish/nude color with a sparkly finish that’s coppery.

He really likes Death Grip and the old-fashioned Clubman soft wax that comes tinted in a tube.<br /><br />This Tree-Topped Mustache Wax is solid in a little tin like the Death Grip, but it's slightly softer - soft enough you can dig some out of the tin and apply it just with the warmth of your hands without having to warm up the whole tin in hot water or with a blow dryer. But since it's a little softer instead of a rock-hard wax, it's also has a little less hold. I'd call it a medium-firm hold.<br /><br />Absolutely love that it's simple, clean, and UNSCENTED! And that they're planting trees for each tin sold! And they even give you the recipe if you want to whip some up and refill your tin yourself. I absolutely will be ordering from this company again!",1

Transferring is minimal. It actually stays a little sticky the whole time while wearing it, so that makes it a little surprising that it's so long lasting- since many liquids dry completely. It's not overly sticky, so I didn't find it bothersome.<br /><br />Applies smoothly- it does feel like a velvety, whipped texture<br /><br />If you're concerned about the appearance of lines on your lips with a liquid lipstick- I feel this is one makes them a bit pronounced.<br /><br />Overall, for a liquid lipstick, I think it's pretty good.

It comes in a super-chic understated black box, and the tube itself is also black and square with a magnetic lid.<br /><br />Calling the shade ""Shimmering"" is an understatement - this shade is GLITTERING. The pigment itself is a really pretty Sienna / rust color that's very flattering on my pale, warm-undertoned skin, and it has a LOT of coppery-gold sparkle. It glides on my lips smoothly and puts down a good amount of pigment (and glitter) in a single swipe. It does feel a little bit gritty from the glitter, but doesn't leave my lips feeling dry at all. It does have a little bit of a scent that smells floral to me.<br /><br />My problem with this particular shade is that the pigment fades (as all lip colors do) throughout the day, but the glitter does NOT. The glitter just migrates outside of your lips and you end up with it all around your mouth. So I personally wouldn't order this shade again. However I like the formula overall, and the fact that it's made in the USA from clean ingredients, so I'm sure the other (non-glittery) colors are amazing and would be right up my alley!",1

Beauty Bakerie's liquid lip is unnervingly sticky for a few minutes while it sets, then it is very dry. If you wear a lot of liquid lipsticks, you know this is par for the course. If it really bothers you, add a tiny bit of balm or gloss (just a touch of Aquaphore will do the trick), but it will affect the longevity. There is no flavor (hooray!) to this lipstick and the split doe's foot (can I call it a cloven hoof?) applicator is super easy to control. And as someone else mentioned, with a color this bold, control is key. Despite it being a dry formula, it doesn't collect in your lip cracks and make your mouth look dry like an old fashioned matte lipstick does. I'm a pasty white middle-aged woman and this color looks awesome on me. I don't have any feathering or running of color, I don't need a lipliner, and the dry formula doesn't bother me because I've been wearing matte lipsticks for years. The price is right in line with similar products by other indie brands. I am so happy with this color and this formula, I can't wait to order Royal Tea. Would love to see this in a ruby slipper red!",1

While it's gentle in that it's not using coarse particles, I didn't enjoy the dry rubbing and tugging at my skin. You can only avoid that over 2 minutes by applying a generous amount of gel, but it's a small tube. My skin looked a little brightened afterwards but not as soft and bright as many other exfoliators (scrubs, peels, masks, serums, etc).

The remover has no scent and really does help remove stubborn polishes! It comes with some instructions, and if you have thick layers of polish you'll want to use a few layers to remove everything. If you follow the instructions and wait the full 6 minutes it should break down your polish with no problems. I think this is a good value, it really does what is advertised.",1

I tried a mini of the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder, so I was excited to try the pressed powder version of it. But, I recently tried the By Terry Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder palette that had 4 different pressed Hyaluronic hydra-powders in it. It had colored powders, not translucent like this one. I got the “Fair to Medium” so it contained a pale pink, a pale bone colored shade, a pale bronzer, and a light bronzer shade. I didn’t like the light colored shades at all for setting my makeup. They seemed to make my skin look so dry, which I thought was so weird since it’s just a pressed version of the loose Hyaluronic hydra powder, which I loved. But, the loose Hyaluronic Hydra Powder only had 2 ingredients - silica and hyaluronic acid. The Hyaluronic Hydra-Powder Palette had a lot more ingredients, so I’m guessing that’s where the difference came from. They were also colored and the loose powder was translucent. This pressed powder is also translucent. It does contain more than 2 ingredients, I guess since it’s in pressed form rather than loose. But not a ton of ingredients (full list at end of review). But, given it had more ingredients and they were similar to the ones in the Hyaluronic Hydra-Pressed Powder Palette I tried and didn’t like, I was worried I wasn’t going to like this one either. But, I’m glad I tried it because I ended up loving it!<br /><br />This comes in a nice outer product box. It comes in a nice compact with clasp closure, a mirror in the lid, and a powder puff. I never use the powder puffs that come in compacts like this, but it seemed nice enough.<br /><br />The powder is very thin. It almost seems like you don’t pick any up when you dip your brush into it, but you do. Usually when I dip my brush into a powder, I have to dab off the excess from the brush before applying it to my face. I don’t have to do that with this. It only picks up a light amount, which is just enough for a very light layer. I have normal to dry skin, more on the dry side with some extremely dry areas. This doesn’t dry out my skin like the powders did in the palette that I tried. This goes on smoothly, sets my makeup in place with a very light layer, and doesn’t look dry, powdery, or cakey on the skin. It lasts well throughout the day.<br /><br />I did notice that if I applied too much, I could get a dry look and feel to my skin. It’s so thin that it’s easy to think you haven’t applied any and to add more, which is when I get the dry look and feel to my skin. With the Pressed Powder Palette I tried, I found those powders worked well with a thin layer and didn’t leave my skin looking and feeling dry, but they also didn’t seem to set my makeup in place unless I applied more, which ended up giving me the dry look and feel. With this powder, I can apply a very small amount and my makeup seems to be set in place well and I don’t get a dry look and feel to the skin. So, I’m not sure why I got such a different result with the powders in the Pressed Powder Palette vs this one. Given they have similar ingredient lists aside from the color ingredients, the only thing I can think of is that this one is translucent and those ones in the palette were colored so that much<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a great powder! It’s very thin and looks like nothing on the skin, but sets my makeup in place. It doesn’t feel or look dry on my skin.

But it was so cute that I had to come back for one for myself. I'm  not a huge fan of tortoise shell print but this pink one is super pretty! It's a thick sturdy plastic and isn't flimsy. Think of it as a scaled down shower comb. It's good for getting some tangles out of your hair while on the go (not so much for fine tuning your hair style). It's a small enough size where it doesn't take up much room in your purse. It also comes with a decently made carrying pouch with a snap closure to prevent the comb from getting entangled with other items in your purse.,1

(I love Jeffree Star’s formula best) and I exclusively wear them because of the longevity, i do not like to have to keep putting lipstick on. If you’ve tried a lot of liquid lipsticks, you’ll know that formulas can be hit and miss. Some are very flaky when they dry, some smudge. Some are a perfect consistency, and i can’t say I’ve found many of those. But this is one of them.<br /><br />The colour is fantastic and looks amazing on my 56 year old freckly face. It’s a doe foot applicator, and is fairly easy to apply if you're confident with liquid lipstick. It’s richly pigmented, and one coat was enough.<br /><br />I did not find this to be flaky when it dried. It did take marginally longer than some other brands, but once it dried, it’s properly smudge proof. It looks great as is, or with a gloss on top if you like that look.

AE7ZWVM3BUBG5OFF37ALYQHHVHVQ,B0B4MR9BXN,4,2022-08-11 19:49:13.351,Calming face balm,"This is a Korean face balm, that is supposed to sooth sensitive skin and cover up redness on the skin. The instructions and all the ads on Amazon are in Korean, and I HIGHLY recommend that the sellers switch this to include English instructions. I had to go to their website in order to find out the ingredients and what it was supposed to do for the skin, and most people aren't going to do that.<br />To continue, the balm contains 2 plant ingredientspine sprouts and centella asiatica roots.  The cica pine water helps sooth and moisturize sensitive skin.  The color in the balm comes from calamine powder, which helps cover red areas of the skin.  It is a 100% vegan formula.  The balm comes in a compact with a puff applicator.  The puff is eco-friendly and anti-bacterial.  This is meant to be applied as the last step during the skincare routine and before you apply your makeup.<br /><br />Overall, I found this product easy to apply.  You dip the poof into the cream balm, and then apply it to the skin. It has an almost creamy texture on the skin, and absorbs in quickly.  It has a slight white cast when I used it but that went away as it absorbed in.  I was hoping to use this as a color corrective on red areas on my skin before I applied concealer (I currently do not use foundation).  Overall I think it is nice, but it really hasn't gotten rid of any redness on my skin.  I do like the way it feels though and I think it helps my makeup go on smoother, so I plan to keep using it.",1

I only needed to do one coat. I will say the longevity isn't that great.

If you have done hair removal procedures in the past, you know that it takes a lot of time and you must follow the hair growth process and this could take up to six months to a year to get the results that you want.

They really do help with air flow when your are blow drying your hair.

It’s the perfect size to blow dry my bangs/fringe smooth and silky looking, and give it an impressive curl. I don’t blow dry the rest of my hair with a brush as it’s curly (i use a diffuser on it.) I have a longer section at the back that requires blow drying with a brush, to curl it under a little bit, and because I’ve just recently freshly dyed my hair red, the shine is superb with this.<br /><br />It’s excellent quality, and yes it may cost a little more than your average barrel brush with holes, but in my opinion, the results are worth it.<br /><br />It’s such a pretty colour, and very ergonomic and lightweight in your hand, and comes in a nice box, that it would make a nice Gift.",1

I do however have some trouble with the dispenser pump because it gets finicky and will only pump out product from one side. The component is made of plastic which is why I'm not giving it five stars.

At least I can turn it off if I feel it is getting to hot for me.  But that is where the one missing function is really glaring.  You can not use this thing with just bubbles.

This mask has been so good for him. He sprays the mask with a bit of water before turning it on and it creates a moist heat that he says makes his eyes feel rested and moisturized when he wakes up the next day. He likes that the strap is adjustable since he likes for it to be a bit loose over his eyes while he sleeps. You can set it at different temperatures and also set the amount of time you want it to stay on and then it turns off. It is so comfortable that many times he falls asleep and does not take it off until he wakes up. This mask has been a great help for my husband's eyes and he is so thankful.,1

I honestly really expected the product to come in a glass jar or something, because of the price...but nah, just plastic. The pump can be problematic, because it does not evenly dispense product from both sides. It probably would have made much more sense to have two pumps. But as for the product itself, I do like what it's been doing for my skin. My skin tends to get very oily, so I have only been using this at night because it does leave your face looking a bit glossy.

I've been using it mostly on acrylic dip powder, but have also used it on top of traditional polish with a clear coat on top. if you apply a light/thin layer (or on dip powder base that has NOT been buffed), it adds a subtle shimmer. If you apply it more thickly AND buff it with the eyeshadow-type applicator, you can achieve a solid chrome look that's really fun as well. I enjoy putting it on all my nails, or just on one nail for a fun accent look that still matches my overall color scheme. I've also enjoyed using it on a relatively plain nail for a fine-textured glitter look while other nails have full-texture glitter. It's really a lot of fun and goes a super long way (basically as far as a comparable eyeshadow palette would go). Strongly recommended<br /><br />UPDATE: I've ditched my acrylic powders (long story - I kayak too much) but couldn't let go of this shimmer. Turns out it works on traditional nail polish as well. You can apply it directly on top for a chrome effect, or BUFF (not file) the surface gently then apply for a soft shimmer. In both cases top with clearcoat. I still love this palette!",1

With such small, hooded eyes, a lot of full lashes can end up poking me in my inner corner. I like the inner corner of the lashes to be shorter. Somehow, I missed seeing that the inner corner of the “A201” style was the same length as the outer corner. I also like the outer corner to be longer and lifted to give my eye a more lifted look. While the “A201l style isn’t bad, it isn’t as good as “A202” would have been. I’m not sure how I picked so wrong 😂 I think I just saw the “A201” style looked more natural and “A202” looked darker/thicker/fuller, so I went with the more natural looking ones? No clue! I’m usually so picky when choosing lashes and so particular, I don’t know how I missed that! But, “A201” worked well enough.<br /><br />I liked the idea of self adhesive lashes. No glue, no magnetic liner, no magnets. Just pop them on and be done! Easy peasy!  I had a feeling they weren’t going to stick to well, but figured they were worth a try because…..”WHAT IF THEY DID?! Wouldn’t that be something?!”<br /><br />They did stick….but not for long. These are perfect for anyone who only needs the lashes to feel secure for no more than a couple hours, after that, they start lifting and feeling like they’ll fall off at any moment. You get 4 pairs for $14.99 (currently down from regular price of $16.99), that is $3.75 (or $4.25 at regular price) per pair. Not too bad. At that price, some might not mind them only feeling secure for a short while. Like if you’re someone who does makeup looks on Instagram/TikTok/YouTube/etc., you might only need the lashes on for a quick photo session or video. These would work well for that.<br /><br />They did say you need to apply these BEFORE makeup. I tried it that way and then applied my eyeshadow and it was fine. I also applied them after applying my eyeshadow. They stayed secure longer when applied BEFORE eyeshadow, but did stay secure for about 40 min when applied AFTER eyeshadow.<br /><br />After the first use, they don’t stick very well. If you applied them to clean, dry skin, they stick much better and stay secured longer. But if applied to eyeshadow, they don’t stick as well the second time, even if you make sure to clean them off after.<br /><br />Overall, I can’t really recommend these unless you only want lashes that will be quick to apply (few seconds), don’t need them to last longer than a couple hours, and don’t mind getting only a use or 2 out of them. If that works for you, go for it because they do stick.",0

Within just a few strokes, I had removed enough hair from my cats to form a whole other cat!  One of my girls loved it, but the one who usually enjoys being brushed didn't care for it.  Not sure what's up with that.  It wasn't hurting her, I think maybe since it grabbed so much hair, maybe she didn't like the extra little ""tug"".  There are 2 different curves to the brush and I didn't really notice a difference in the effects.  I also tried to rake the rug, which I have done with my usual brush.  This was absolutely not working with this one.  It grabbed so much it was actually lifting the carpet.  This worked on fine cat hair, so I can only imagine how well it would grab the hair and de-shed a dog.  I didn't have any use for the added light and strap.  I suppose the strap would be useful to hold a dog with a collar in place and the light would be useful for potty trips at night.",1

The sealed tub also had a plastic cover under the the lid and was boxed. The scrub had a little brown in it like what you might see when fruit starts to rot or in yogurt, but it's dated good until 9/14/2023, so I felt okay using it. The red particles made my husband and I realize we didn't confidently know the color of strawberry seeds, but I think they are. They feel kind of squishy, and the scrub feels more like a creamy moisturizing lotion. It does smell like strawberries and makes skin soft. This is a different scrub that feels gentle. I personally prefer one that feels like it's polishing and cleaning more than moisturizing though. This is currently $12.",1

My eye area looked hydrated and more refreshed after use.<br /><br />I do agree with the other reviewer who mentioned that they expected a box for the pump bottle, not it arriving just in the bottle and shrink wrapped.

If you’ve ever had them clogged before than you know the discomfort that comes with it. I’ve actually had a tube put in my right tear duct to clear a blockage and that is dreadful to go through. It has been recommended that I use warm/hot (not scolding) compress to help keep my tear ducts draining. I’m trying this mask to save time. It’s easier than standing at the sink and constantly warming up a wash cloths with the faucet. It’s definitely relaxing and I can feel how it is going to help me.

When I opened it there's no smell which is nice. The blood drips beautifully and semi dries nicely. If you want a realistic messy look you can tap it with a pad or just use a syringe to drop water.<br /><br />As the bottle says, this will not dry so be careful for extra drops I advise using a light amount of hairspray/setting spray to attempt to keep it in place. (no promises just a potential tip) always do a skin test! this says its 'mouth safe' but I'm so glad I did the skin test, otherwise the antihistamine might not have been enough.<br /><br />Pros: seriously beautiful, realistic, a little goes a long way, thick, and a nice applicator.<br /><br />Cons:I was allergic, might be a bit too tacky for some.<br /><br />I do recommend this even though I had a reaction to it. Everyone is different so if you're looking for good realistic blood this is your buy just test first. Happy blood beauty to all!",1

I was a swimmer and lifeguard for half of my life or so. So I have spent countless amount of time being bare foot, in and our of pools, and loving feeling the ground on the soles of my feet. I live in a warm climate for most of the year so I wear flip flops for 75% of the year. And my feet reflect that. It’s easy to see how dry my feet are. I have tried a foot mask treatment from this company that did not help with my callouses BUT, this cream is incredible. It immediately softened my two callouses. This cream doesn’t have a scent and it has phenomenal ingredients.<br /><br />Upon first use my feet feel and look instantly and deeply moisturized. I must admit I rarely moisturize my feet. I have hard floors so, I usually don’t consider moisturizing my feet because I don’t want to slip. This is a heavy cream. You really don’t need much to coat both of your feet. For me, a dime size for each foot or quarter size for both feet works perfectly. I’m actually shocked how moisturizing this feels on my usually tough feet. You can really feel the coconut oil in this product. It feels like a really rich and intensely moisturizing cream. I would highly recommend this to any one who loves to be bare foot or spends lots of time bare foot or in flip flops. ☀️🩴",1

They do give a cat eye look to you but i dont think they suit my face shape! My face and head are far too big to allow any attention to the eyelashes😜so they are not as noticeable as i would have liked!!! But to each thier own! Maybe another face shape would work with these!!!,1
AECTRGMRKOGAYIV3YXX73CQEQCSQ,B0B9C3C8SS,4,2022-09-20 11:30:03.815,Not bad at all,I tried some of these contour sticks in the past and they don't always work super well but I quite like this one. The highlight is especially nice. I just wanted it for a little bit of inner corner highlight and this gives me a parallescent glow without any glitter. It looks really nice. The contour side is a little warmer than I would like and it's not the easiest to blend out but you can make it work. It's really more of a good color of a cream bronzer but because it's not the easiest to blend I don't prefer to use it that way. However it is nice to have that extra bit of color to throw on and there's a lot of convenience to having this dual-sided item. You can do a lot with them.,1

These are fairly simple to apply. I found the best way to apply these is to cut out the mouth as close as possible and I also cut a straight slit between the teeth area - cutting all the way thru the paper before applying. Then I simply lined up over my lips and wet paper with sponge and peeled off.<br />Easy to remove with baby oil or rubbing alcohol. Olive oil also works!<br />These tattoos are so much fun for Halloween! Also great for a few laughs!<br />Great value!,1

It’s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I’m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don’t know what’s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won’t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it’s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I’d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can’t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it’s so soft I can’t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don’t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in Korea.",0

You put it over the brush end without bristles and slide it up over the bristles. You can slide it down when you’re using the brush so you don’t have to take it off.

I was really excited to try them out because they look so cool when I've seen them on social media. I would say they are sized like regular mouths, so perfect for older kids and even adults but they wont be super large. They apply easily with water, I would just wait a minute or two before opening your mouth so its dry, You want to make sure to create the opening slowly and that its adhered to your lips or it will tear and ruin the effect. I was able to take it all of with make up remover without too much scrubbing.",1

Works well when used correctly,"This is ONLY meant for GEL polish NOT for acrylic powder, dip powder, Poly gel, or builder gel. Why? I don’t know. I’m guessing whatever chemicals in it breakdown the gel polish won’t breakdown the acrylic powder, dip powder, Poly gel, or builder gel in the same way.<br /><br />This works great! I have tried other gel polish remover before and they just don’t feel right on the nail. It’s hard to describe, but it’s just a weird feeling I get in my nail bed when I’ve applied them. I’ve been trying out different ones hoping to find one that doesn’t feel like that and works really well…I finally found one!<br /><br />This is easy to use.<br />-USE NAIL FILE TO REMOVE TOP COAT. This step is important. A lot of people think this step isn’t necessary with a gel polish remover like this. That it’ll remove the top coat too. It might, I haven’t tried it. But, I’m guessing it wouldn’t do it as quickly and easily. Just take a nail file and lightly buff off the top coat. It doesn’t take much.<br />-Apply a thin coat of the gel polish remover just like you would any nail polish<br />-Let it sit for 3-8 minutes. It will start to crack/bubble.<br />-Take a cuticle pusher and use it to push off the nail polish. It should push off easily. You can always add another coat of the remover if it’s not fully off.<br /><br />I found for me with 2 coats of gel polish on, it usually took me about 10 minutes from start to finish. So much easier than acetone or even a drill! As long as you remove the top coat by filing it off before applying this remover and give it time to work and soften the polish, it’s easy to scrape off!<br /><br />As a side note, even though this says it’s not meant for acrylic powder, dip powder, builder gel, or Poly gels, I tried it with dip powder. It worked well but did take longer for it to crack/bubble and I had to do 2 coats of the remover. It also worked much better when it was a solid color dip powder and not a dip powder with glitter in it.",1

While you still do need to be careful peeling it off, it’s tougher than other stickers. These hold on better and don’t break apart easily. I was able to decorate my nails using tweezers. I could even lift them again to adjust their position if needed. They look good and have a strong pigment.<br />The only cons I would say is that I like to have symmetry. Some stickers did not have a pair and it was disappointing. Also, the nail art sticker are called “skull stickers” but the majority were snakes. I like skulls more and was looking forward to it.<br /><br />In any case, I’m still able to enjoy them.  The art is clean and pretty. I want more !",1

If by some miracle you DO manage to get it on and in a good placement you then can't move your mouth at all.  No talking, eating, or drinking.  I have seen suggestions about cutting a slit in the tattoo - but that just makes it move and fall apart so it's not worth it.<br /><br />Overall - you get 10 for a cheap price - probably better to put them in a separate area other than the mouth and go for a weird look rather than use it like a mask.",0

I don't like to draw that much attention to myself and the color wasn't quite right for me, so it was a bit much for me at first, but I've figured out how to apply it to best suit me.  I found that if I apply a light layer of this over my usual lipstick it adds just a bit of deeper color and a shimmer to give it a nice new look.  I also found that if I do just a light layer of only this lipstick the color is more subtle and suits me better.  If you like a lot of sparkle, you will love this.  It really leaves your lips shining in the sunlight.  Occasionally some of the glitter flakes will land on other places on you too, but it isn't really bad about that.  The lipstick itself is a really good lipstick.  It glides on easily and evenly and feels moisturizing.  You will notice more of the moisturizing feeling if you apply it heavily, however, so with my light application that feeling doesn't last long.  The color doesn't seem to last any longer than any other lipstick, but I never feel like any of them last too long.  The case of this lipstick is actually quite nice as well.  It is very smooth and shiny and has a bit of a weighted feel to it.  The lid is magnetic so as you go to close it up the lid snaps itself shut.  I appreciate the lack of parabens, sulfates, etc and that it is cruelty free as well.  Due to the fact that the current listed price of $42 for one stick of lipstick is quite above budget for me, I will not purchase this one again.  However, if that weren't the case, I would be interested in trying some of the other shades.",1

That page has no bullet points, only one photo.<br />They do have another listing for this same exact device, showing the accessories, extra photos with bits of information, and bullet points telling a little about it. I got my information from there.<br />The device does have the cooling feature, as many others do, which helps it not to zap too badly. It also comes with a razor and eye protection.<br />What it lacks, that many others include that are in or around this price range, is more attachments for the device. There needs to be at least one smaller light head for use around the lip area, as it's very hard to use the main one with the device being so large.<br />This IPL device works pretty much as well as any other, with none having the ability to make you completely hair-free at any point in the future. As far as the studies that I have seen, with diligent use, home IPL devices can only offer a little better than 50-60%-ish less hair.<br />My preferred device, which costs very little more than this one, has several attachments, including some specifically for skin rejuvenation. You do get a fancy box with this device, and it looks nice, but I don't think it provides any more or less than devices that cost much less.<br />I haven't found one yet that really only takes 10 minutes to do your legs, but if I ever do, that is the one that would probably take the cake! If you like fancy boxes and a sleek-looking device, I would recommend this one.",1
AFGCJIO7DNVCCZPG4KVMKKXVPJLQ,B09WN3KBDF,3,2022-10-04 02:42:35.160,Cute - works OK - doesn’t get too warm…No directions,This eye massage thing doesn’t come with any directions. Now it’s not rocket science but I would like to know if there’s supposed to be heat in each function - if it supposed to pulse on the blue and the red light etc. I say this because I think there’s only heat when the red light is on. The rest seem to have no heat.  And it is very light - very slight heat as it is. It makes me question is there even heat or has my face heated the crystal up. So I was really expecting it to have much more heat. Also with both the red and the blue light it’s not a constant vibration - it’s kind of like a pulse vibration it goes on and it goes off then it goes on and it goes off.<br /><br />I do like that you can use it without the red or the blue light because the third setting is just a vibration - and that one is a constant vibration. But again that setting seems to have no heat at all.<br /><br />The crystal does seem to be some kind of quartz. It is a clear type of crystal so I assume it’s quartz because quartz is pretty common.<br /><br />It feels pretty nice around my eyes and if you hold it a certain way the red and/or or blue light will not get into your eye - you won’t see it while you use it. And I do like that. So this is OK and it looks just like a tube of lipstick.,0

AEKZVUWFM4AVGF2JGBGPVRKKIUHA,B0BBG78CPP,5,2022-10-05 22:31:40.033,I❤️the cooling tip on this device👍⭐️,"This device comes in a very nice case for storage. The protective glasses 👓 even come in a very nice case. The directions are quite detailed so there is no need for me to discuss that in this review. If you purchase this device you’ll see.<br /><br />Operating an IPL device is pretty simple if you follow the directions. It’s choosing the level, making sure you don’t miss a spot and having the patience/commitment to follow through with it to get the results you want.<br /><br />I have seen reviews under many IPL hair removal devices that says they used it for a month and they didn’t see any results. Well, it does take time. Like I said, if you are committed, patience and consistent, then any IPL device will work. This particular device recommends using ONCE a week for 12 weeks, and then once a month there after for maintenance. Most people want to see results by snapping their fingers, and that just isn’t going to happen, even if you do go to a professional, and have it done, it takes time. My advice, if you are not in the mood to take the time, don’t have the patience and or not going to be committed, then don’t get one of these devices because you would be wasting your money.<br /><br />It took about 4 weeks or 4 treatments before I really started to notice results. First noticed the hair on the underarms because it had become finer, thinner, softer hair that was growing. My bikini 👙 area had spots that the hair didn’t grow back but other spots where it was finer, thinner & softer hair. Even though I had spots with NO HAIR growing back, I still go over all the areas regardless. My left armpit has no hair growing at this time, but I still do a treatment. Once I get to the proper weeks since I first started the treatments, then and only then I will 🛑 treating areas where no hair grows.<br /><br />My legs 🦵🏼 have been frustrating but it’s definitely working. The problem is that I miss areas each time I do a treatment. There’s no way of getting the entire leg each time. I have come up with a pattern I do that helps me the best. I start at my ankle and go around my leg 🦵🏼 in a circle ⭕️ while spiraling 🌀 up my leg. I found that going up and down is when I was missing the most. Doing a spiral has helped me tremendously.<br /><br />On the days I am scheduled to do another treatment, I shave 🪒 the areas that I’m going to treat. I also exfoliate the areas using  [[ASIN:B099HDG45M Revealer Skin Exfoliator]]. Then about an half hour after I shave 🪒, I start me treatments. KEEP YOUR LEGS DRY, CLEAN AND NO LOTIONS/OILS ETC. NOTHING.<br />ALWAYS WEAR THE PROTECTIVE 👓 GLASSES!<br />Since I shave my underarms first, I start there. Underarms takes about 2 minutes each. Then I do my bikini 👙 area and then onto my legs. If I think I forgot a spot I do go back and do it, but I really try to pay attention so I don’t. Once complete I either apply [[ASIN:B0B1N8Z7BR Reviver Skin Soothing Gel]] or [[ASIN:B073WVKRBN USDA Certified Jojoba Oil]]. Both are soothing, but sometimes I feel I need a decent moisturizer and Jojoba Oil is my go to for that.<br /><br />Well, that’s how I do each treatment. I also put in my schedule/calendar📅 when I’m supposed to do my next treatment. It is time consuming, but the results are so worth it. Think off all the money you are going to save by NOT having to buy EXPENSIVE RAZORS 🪒 anymore. Not to mention the time saved in the shower 🚿.<br /><br />HOPE THIS HELPS others understand a little of how it works. 👍I feel very comfortable using this device and knew going into it, this is a commitment and requires patience.",1

The eye massager comes with a protective tip cap/cover and looks like a cute lipstick.<br />I like to use first the red light, heat, massage with my eye serum and then I use blue light, heat massage, with my eyecream. I am using this device only on my eyes(I have full face device with a larger head). It feels very soothing on my eyes and helps with puffiness too.

The second is the blue light which cools the massage stone and provides a pulsating massage. The Third leaves the stone at room temperature with no light indicator, and provides a constant massage vibration. Hall of the massage settings feel nice on your under eye area, but I didn’t find that they helped in absorption of my under eye creams, nor did they help with  any under eye discoloration or puffiness. So though the massage tool felt nice on my under eye area, I didn’t find any effectiveness that would necessitate use of this on a regular basis.",0

IPL's are not effective for all skin and hair color types. Please research online as there are several infographics on how effective laser therapy is on each color type. This is the main reason why some reviews rave about the results and some are so disappointed.<br />That being said...<br />This is the most compact IPL device that I've tried, but it packs all the new features you are looking for. I personally have not reached the intensity where I need the cooling function, but it's nice knowing it's there when I reach that point. I do like the compact size, but wish there was more grip to the exterior. Everything is smooth and I came close to dropping the thing the first time I used it. So be careful handling it. One of the newer trends on these devices is to have the invisible screen, instead of a visible LCD screen. When you turn it on, the data lights are under the gold rectangle and illuminate to show the functions etc.<br />I personally have had great success with IPL devices, since I fit the designated hair and skin color.

This one is the first painless one I have had.<br />Everything is packaged well and comes in a nice case. The machine itself is very easy to use. Once you turn it on, it automatically turns on a cooling mechanism that makes it more pleasant on the skin and less likely to overheat, I would imagine. I would recommend that you read the directions or watch a video on how to operate it. It has different settings that you can change by clicking the right button. There is also a long or short area function on this which is very nice, making it so you can drag the device down a longer area, like a leg, while pressing the button.<br />The directions say to use the device want to eat for 12 weeks and after that, as needed. I will update the review if sufficient hair removal has not happened at this point in time, but I’m already noticing that I have to shave less.",1

My daughter’s curly hair can’t be washed every day and she can’t figure out how to shower or bathe without getting her hair wet. This is the perfect solution.

So I was excited to see these because I thought I could stick the little covers to the lid and it would be perfect for storing the little dippers. Unfortunately, the little suckers only stay on for a minute or two before they pop off. I have put a drop of water on them which helps the suction cups attach better, but they still fall off after a minute or two.

I started using them due to toenail fungus, and a stubborn fingernail fungus -- thanks to gel polishes from the nail salon. I discovered Dr's Remedy polishes a couple of years ago, and have totally switched to this brand. They are also good if you have aging, yellowing nails. The polish clears that up -- especially if you consistently use their base coat first.<br /><br />If I have any complaints or suggestions, I would say that they need to add more shades -- especially shades in the neutral family. Some nudes, darker beiges, etc. The khaki shade is a nice neutral but a bit too pale;, and the few sheer shades they offer are very nice for long-lasting daily wear. I do wish there were more sheer shades -- and maybe a sheer lavender shade that would help combat the yellowed appearance of the nail. But otherwise, this is a wonderful, healthy product and the polish lasts quite a while.",1

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B0B5VP6TZ7,4,2022-10-19 03:02:12.859,Extremely hydrating but lightweight. Does have essential oils & fragrant ingredients though,"This comes with no outer product box, just the bottle. But, the bottle is sealed with plastic wrapping around it. It is made in the US. The ingredients are listed on the label.<br /><br />This is supposed to be cruelty free, gluten free, silicone free, sulfate free, paraben free, talc free, 100% vegan, and have clean ingredients. It didn’t have any labels on it saying it was cruelty free, but the brand’s website said they’re cruelty free. It also said they use natural and organic ingredients. But, they are not certified organic. It states,  “Our products are made with natural and organic ingredients, however, they are not certified organic. All of our products are made in the U.S. using top-quality domesticated and imported ingredients.” I’m not surprised they said they’re not certified organic. I love their honesty. I’ve seen lots of skincare brands claim their products are 100% organic when they definitely aren’t. Most skin care products are water-based and water can NOT be certified as organic, so the possibility of finding a 100% organic skincare product is close to impossible.<br /><br />This claims to be hydrating, brightening, and soothing. It claims to target fine lines around the eyes, reduce appearance of dark circles and puffiness, and hydrate the eye area. It claims the key ingredients are triple peptides, bergamot oil, and citric acid. I included a full ingredient list at the end of my review (marked with 🟣). I included some info on some of the ingredients before that (marked with 🟢).<br /><br />This comes in a nice pump bottle. The pump does squirt out too much if you’re not careful. I find if I carefully press it so I’m not pushing it down all the way, I get enough product and don’t waste any. It’s a thin gel consistency. It glides on nicely. It absorbs quickly leaving my under eyes feeling really hydrated and smooth. I have pretty dry under eyes. If I apply concealer, I have to make sure to moisturize them really well so they don’t look dry and cakey. A lot of the moisturizers that hydrate my under eyes enough are thicker and end up being too heavy to use concealer over. This is PERFECT! It’s thin and lightweight, but feels extremely hydrating! It gives my under eyes enough hydration and plumps them up. It doesn’t leave a sticky residue at all. Concealer goes over it beautifully and looks nice and smooth.<br /><br />I haven’t been using it long enough to say anything about how it works long term on dark circles, firming, etc. But, I can say it’s really hydrating and plumping if you’re looking for something extremely hydrating under the eyes. I’m hopeful for other benefits long term given the ingredients, but even if I don’t get any more benefits, I’m still loving how well it hydrates my under eyes while being so lightweight!  Just keep in mind it does have some essential oils and fragrant ingredients in it, so if you have sensitive skin, you might want to avoid this or at least check the ingredient list to see if they’re things that you’re sensitive to.<br /><br />🟢Info on ingredients<br />Saccharide Isomerate, which is a 100% natural and plant-derived moisturizer. It binds to the skin stronger and longer than other moisturizer ingredients do so it can keep skin hydrated longer than usual.<br /><br />Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1 & Palmitoyl Tetrrapeptide-7 - These are peptides combined to create a compound called Matrixyl 3000. Matrixyl is a highly-effective peptide composition that has been shown to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, fill in fine lines & wrinkles while restoring elasticity.<br /><br />Sodium Hyaluronate, which is a form of hyaluronic acid (HA). Helps skin hold onto water, making skin more plump and elastic.<br /><br />Acetyl Hexapeptide-8 (aka Argireline), which is called “natures Botox.” It is a synthetic peptide that has several different potential wrinkle-fighting and anti-aging effects. It's so effective, that experts say it's the closest thing to Botox you can get. It prevents the muscle movement that leads to wrinkle formation. Argireline also promotes collagen production and optimizes the function of collagen, which both fight fine lines and improve moisture levels in the skin. It’s good for anyone looking to smooth wrinkles caused by repeated muscle movement in areas such as the forehead and around the eyes.<br /><br />Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, which has great anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />ESSENTIAL OILS, PERFUMING INGREDIENTS<br />It has some essential oils and perfuming ingredients in it - Bergamot Fruit Oil, Orange Oil, Linalyl Acetate, Geranyl Acetate, and Linalool. These are super common and cheap fragrance ingredients. They oxidize on air exposure and the result can be quite irritating to the skin and can lead to allergic contact dermatitis and they count as frequent skin sensitizers. It is best to avoid them if you have sensitive skin.<br /><br />🟣FULL INGREDIENT LIST<br />Water, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Saccharide Isomerate, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Sodium Hyaluronate, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Carrageenan, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis Oil, Sclerotium Gum, Xanthan Gum, Carbomer, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Sodium Citrate, Triethyl Citrate, Linalyl Acetate, Geranyl Acetate, Terpineol, Linalool, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin.",1

The thing you need to check for is the power of each laser. For instance many cheap IPL will say there joules rating is between 2-6 joules typically. At salons it varies but it’s typically between 20-50 joules. And that means the higher the joules usually the better the results or faster because it’s actually hitting the hair with that higher power.<br /><br />This IPL device has 5 levels between 6-20 joules. That is typically as high as you’ll find for at home IPL devices. So at the highest level you’ll get the low end of salon quality laser removal.<br /><br />Be very careful with the higher levels though, just because it can reach that power doesn’t mean it will be the best result for your skin. So be careful, follow directions and make sure to not damage your skin",1

It can be a little warm wearing it but it's perfect for keeping the water out.

That way you can always just be washing the old one if you need to. I prefer cloth ones for sleeping. But this could def work if you have some sort of leave in overnight conditioner situation.",1

AEMP3A7IKW37CMWFXNKXWW6HGJHA_1,B0B4MR9BXN,3,2022-10-26 17:23:58.080,"Reduced redness & hydrating, but need ingredient list in ENGLISH!","This comes in a nice outer product box. Made in Korea. The brand’s website said it’s 100% vegan, excluding animal ingredients and animal experiments. It also doesn’t include parabens.<br /><br />It comes in a nice compact. It’s a compact like a cushion foundation where you open it and there’s a kind of lid that holds the sponge applicator, and you lift that lid to reveal the product. You press the applicator sponge into it (or your own sponge or brush) and then apply it. The brand’s website said the included sponge applicator is an “eco puff” made of “eco-friendly corns” and is “99.9% anti-bacterial and water-repellent,” which makes it safe on skin and keeps puff clean.<br /><br />This is a liquidy but balm kind of texture. It isn’t as thick as a balm. It just feels like a cushion foundation. But this isn’t a foundation. It has a very light, mint green color to it. It’s so light that it’s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn’t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It’s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn’t a primer really, it doesn’t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it’s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn’t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn’t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I’m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what’s in my products. I don’t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren’t in English. They also didn’t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it’s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand’s website to find out more. Yes, it’s a simple Google search, but it’s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand’s website to find the list of ingredients when they’re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn’t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn’t think they were accurate because they didn’t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I’m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn’t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I’d guess you’d call them, of centella asiatica. There’s nothing else listed. It’s kind of odd. The brand’s website said this is supposed to have “2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.” I saw the “centella asiatica roots” in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn’t see any “pine sprout.” I also saw something about “cica pine water” on the brand’s website, but again, not sure what that’s supposed to be? The brand’s website also mentioned “Natural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.” Again, I didn’t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It’s less prominent than it’s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I’d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don’t like they didn’t include them and don’t like that they can’t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don’t know. If the ingredients aren’t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I’d look elsewhere. There’s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand’s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand’s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%).

It’s safe for sensitive skin and pregnant women! It’s not photosensitive (unlike retinol) so it can be used both am and pm. The packaging of this product feels simple yet luxurious. The glass jar packaging reminds me a lot of herbivore products.<br /><br />This cream is lovely to use. It is a thicker heavier cream so, it does take a little longer to absorb. It’s non greasy and although it is a thick cream it does feel light weight once applied. As the cream absorbs it does give a nice radiant dewy glow to my skin tone. I can easily see how this cream would help with anti aging and fine lines with repeated daily use. I’ve been using this cream for about almost a week now and I love seeing my skin so well nourished and hydrated.<br /><br />The ingredients in the cream are delightful. There is one ingredient that I always acknowledge. This cream does use a silicone ingredient polysilicone-34. I honestly don’t know much about this silicone ingredient and it might be the first product I have used that includes this particular silicone. This cream is gentle and effective even for sensitive skin but I do always acknowledge silicones in the ingredient list. In the week I have used this cream I have not noticed any close comedones, millia or any other adverse side effects from adding this cream to my skin care routines.<br /><br />I love how deeply nourishing, refreshed and hydrating this cream is for my skin. Even though it takes a while to absorb when I use this cream in the mornings its still easy to apply my make up once this cream does absorb. I don’t wear foundation most days but occasionally I do wear a finishing powder to even out my skin tone if need or to help blend out my highlighter or blush. This cream doesn't sit heavy on my skin or interfere with my make up application or longevity.<br /><br />I am very happy with this cream and would absolutely recommend it to those who have sensitive skin (as long as you tolerate silicone okay), or to those who prefer a retinol alternative that can still yield good results.",1

It is light, but it does take a bit more time than usual to fully absorb into the skin. It's vegan though and it has this deliciously eucalyptus clean smell.

I will try another fragrance from them this time just for a difference. the pellets melt evenly in my pot and went on easier. I DO use an exfoliator in conjunction with this wax to prevent ingrown hairs but I'm happy with the fragrance and am excited to try their others.

I only used it on a cowlick and it did great! I followed the steps and combed the cowlick down and kept it that way and it is now not an issue for me. I am a man, have platinum (naturally) hair, and despise my cowlick. But, for now, it is gone!

They always love getting a product used they've never heard of before. This helps with hiding moderate redness. But I wouldn't necessarily depend on it for sole color correction. It does well good under foundation. At least the ones I use. Is it worth the price? That depends on each person's financial situation.,1
AFV33VZ7QL345BNRQRV42WD56RMQ,B0BGS9F2FM,5,2022-11-15 13:07:54.305,Great spray foundation,"I have been using Jerome Alexander Airbrush spray foundation for a while now and enjoy it, so when this came up I knew I had to give it a try.<br /><br />Normal liquid foundations feel very thick and seem to visibly sit on top of my skin. When buffed in with a kabuki brush, this blended very nicely. Shake the can well and spray directly onto the brush for the best results. I aim onto my shower just in case I accidentally overspray. Some people complain about the waste of the spray in these types of foundations. First, you should only be spraying about 3 inches away from your brush. Ny further and you risk missing the brush altogether. Second, I spray in short bursts. A little goes a long way, and I was impressed by the color match in this foundation. It holds up well and looks very natural.",1
AHSIR56YDJL76VXSFEKI5YQPYJ2Q,B0BGS9F2FM,4,2022-11-15 13:08:06.611,Very full coverage,"When I ordered this there were only two shade choices, fair light and medium.  I am a light neutral usually so I chose fair light.  It is too light for me but not so light that I can't make it work with bronzer. The instructions say to spray it on their brush then apply it. I wanted to spray it directly on my face so I did and it is the most immediate full coverage application I've ever had.  You do need to be careful because you could end up with it in your hair and whatnot. I also sprayed it on my sponge and applied it like that.  It worked fine that way but it wasn't as full coverage.<br />This takes a while to dry down and if you're like me and don't set your face this could be a problem when you're applying the rest of your makeup.  I did feel like my contour and bronzer was removing the foundation somewhat.  Once it dried down completely though it stayed.  The finish seemed more matte to me than satin but I have dry skin so that could be why. I think this is a really nice foundation but it takes some work. Also I seriously hope they do something about the shade range.",1

Greenery is to soothe you for a peaceful afternoon. Of course, it can be used anytime as needed<br />The concept behind this three-oil blend is to soothe body mind and soul, using Hemp seed oil to soothe the skin, Bergamot oil to soothe the mind and the visually calming green imparted by the Holy Basil oil to soothe the spirit.<br />The oil feels, silky, the fragrance is light and balanced, all three oils combining to create a mellow scent. The ingredients are natural, organic, and ecofriendly.<br />The directions encourage you to make this a moment. Specifically, after cleansing and toning, drop the oil into the palm, inhale to stimulate the senses and tap your skin gently until the oil is absorbed.<br />A few drops provided good coverage and after patting it in, took a little while to sink in. It never felt sticky, or heavy, just a light silky layer that once absorbed left my skin feeling soft and nourished.<br />The care taken in producing this is apparent, even to the presentation.

I did apply one just to write this review and it applied the same as any temporary tattoo with water. I first applied lipstick and put the back of the tattoo on my mouth so I could see where my lips would need to open. Then I cut out a little piece for my mouth and that worked well when applying the tattoo. But honestly, they should have thought of that when selling tattoos that go over your mouth. You have to somehow find a way to create an opening for your lips. So, based on the hassle of creating my own opening, I don't think I would order these again. However, overall these tattoos work just fine.",1

It goes on nice and smooth and leaves my skin hydrated well. I love that all the ingredients are Natural, Vegan, as well as Cruelty free, all important to me! This blended oil Smells Really Good!<br /><br />I really enjoy using products that have hemp seed oil and bergamot oil. The use of hemp seed oil in this product serves as a carrier oil as well as soothes and moisturizes your skin. Bergamot helps to calm your skin as well as acts as an anti-inflammatory agent. Holy Basil is also used in this blend of oils and helps improve your skins elasticity. All three of these ingredients work well in concert with each other.<br /><br />Since this is an oil based skincare product, it’s best to apply at bedtime. Oil based products take longer to absorb into your skin, so nighttime/bedtime is the best to apply.<br /><br />This product arrives in a nice frosted glass bottle with a built in dropper. You receive 1.01fl oz of the oil, It comes in a pretty white box. This would make a wonderful Christmas gift to any of your family members or a close friend.<br /><br />I DO Recommend this product as it works really well.

Otherwise, I have to straighten my hair every day to look decent. I have been using this Japanese product which is a 2-step for the straightening and neutralizing. It usually takes a total of 3 hours or more to go through the entire process, with 45 mins session for each treatment steps and then the drying and straightening hair in between. I was really intrigued with the one-step because it saves so much time.<br /><br />The order comes with magic straightening kit to do at home. There are instruction manuals in both Korean and English. It gives you step by step instructions that are very clear and easy to follow. The bottle already comes with the treatment. All you need to do it apply. Before you do this, there are hair treatment packets to use prior and after the treatment to protect your hair from excessive damage. The kit also comes with plastic cover for your shoulders and a brush for application.<br /><br />I applied it over the top area because my hair is pretty long and really you should only target the new hair growth if you've done the treatment previously. If it was my first time I probably would not have enough treatment for my long hair. I would need to order two.<br /><br />The instruction states to check after 10 minutes. Every hair is different so you will have to assess if you need to leave it on longer. The instruction specifies the duration and also guides you on how to check if your hair is ready to be washed out. If you pull one strand and you notice the curls are gone, then it's probably time to wash them. I left mine on for 40 minutes. I don't recommend it but I needed to from past experience because my hair is crazy. You rinse out the treatment but it tells you not to rub them. Just wash them through gently with your fingers. I applied the hair mist after washing it out, because you can feel the hair stiffen. Then I proceeded to blow dry and straighten the hair.<br /><br />I washed my hair again after 2 days and sure enough the treatment worked. I do feel that because of the dryness, I still need to straighten the hair some, but definitely better than having to sit every morning and straighten the entirety of the hair.<br /><br />For an avid magic straightening perm treatment user, I do recommend the product. I suggest getting additional product to make sure you revive your hair after treatment.",1

This cleanser has fragrance that smells relatively light to me, though fragrance is an ingredient that poses health risks. I generally avoid foaming face cleansers as they tend to make my skin overly dry, but this has a pleasing creaminess and initially made my skin feel good. It cleaned my skin well yet left it feeling refreshed, soft and comfortable after use.<br /><br />After using this wash more than a few days in a row, it felt more clarifying (better for oily skin) than hydrating to my skin. While it didn’t strip my skin or make it visibly irritated, by the end of the week my skin just didn’t feel as comfortable as it did at first and it felt like my skin would end up too dry if I continued daily use. So I switched back to my creamy, hydrating cleansers, but felt this cleanser would still be good to use as needed as a clarifying cleanser.<br /><br />However, while this wash has some good ingredients such as Centella Asiatica, Aloe Extract and Sodium Hyaluronate, this has controversial Triethanolamine (“TEA”) high on the ingredient list. It’s on my personal list of ingredients to avoid after reading many articles about it and seeing it on lists of risky chemical by many sources. Some sources say it’s safe in amounts we get thru cosmetics, but I’m concerned about the cumulative effect of risky chemicals.<br /><br />TEA is a nitrosamine used to generate foam and adjust pH and is likely a hormone disrupter and irritant. But the bigger issue for me is that TEA gets absorbed through the skin and reacts with other chemicals to form the carcinogen NDEA. While less risky in rinse off products, it still poses more risk than I’m comfortable with. The problem is that I have no way to know if this cleanser or any product I’m using with it has chemicals that react with TEA.<br /><br />So, for me, I find it best to avoid all products with TEA, especially since so many alternative products are available that don’t have it. I also dislike that this has so much Cocamidopropyl Betaine (second ingredient), which I generally avoid mostly due contamination concerns. Fragrance also poses health risks, though it’s a common ingredient I don’t avoid altogether (but I do try and minimize use). All things considered, this is just okay for me. 3 stars.",0

The tube this comes in is nice. It has a matte look to it.<br /><br />The contour stick was what really interested me in this set. So many cream contour sticks labeled as “contour” end up being really warm toned. Contour is supposed to mimic your natural shadows, so it’s supposed to be cool toned, even grey toned. But, it’s hard to find one that’s actually cool toned, and even harder finding one that’s grey toned. This one looked like it was neutral, leaning cool with a kind of rosy undertone. So, I wanted to give it a try. The few rosy/pink toned contour/bronzer sticks I’ve found have worked well for me as bronzers because I have neutral leaning slightly cool skin.<br /><br />On me, thus leans more warm toned than I’d like. But, once blended out, it isn’t as orange as others. Of course, it could be different for you, depending on your undertone. While it doesn’t work as a contour for me like it wanted, it does make a nice bronzer for me. The formula of it is nice. It’s soft, smooth, creamy. It blends easily. I never swipe sticks like these onto my face. I always take my sponge or brush, dab it onto the stick, and then blend it onto my skin. I find that works better and I don’t need to worry about whether swiping it directly on will lift my foundation underneath. This is pigmented, but it blends out so easily that it’s easy to blend it away. I find if I pick up and apply a little, it blends out easily and looks natural on my skin but I just need to be careful not to blend it away! But, I can also build it up for a more intense color. I like that. Once blended out, it is matte and dries down to a powder like finish that I don’t need to set and it lasts all day without any issues.<br /><br />The highlighter is okay. It’s too glittery for my liking. I like more of a pearl look without glitter. But if you don’t mind micro glitter, you might like this. Its really subtle aside from the glitter so I just think there’s better options.<br /><br />Overall, I think it’s worth it for the contour/bronzer side. It works really well and is easy to work with (when dabbing your brush/sponge onto the stick and then applying it) and it sets down on its own with a matte powder like finish without needing to be set. I wouldn’t recommend the highlighter. It’s just really sheer other than glitter so I think there’s better options. But, if you like a sheer but glittery highlighter, then this could work for you. I give it 4 stars because I really like the bronzer, I just don’t like the highlighter.",1

Upon ordering I thought this would be a lovely addition to my skin care routines. I thought I could use it for depuffing, to help increase product absorption or simply to apply a little massage oil before using my myofascial tools. I’m not even entire sure I can utilize this..<br /><br />First the roller part detaches from the lid easily. On unboxing and just checking out the tool I placed the cap back on the tool and then when i went to remove it for first use the roller ball came right off the top. It took me about 15 minutes to be able to twist lock the rolled ball back to the lid. (First photo) Once I got the roller ball re attached and tried to place ice in the main compartment I found you cant get regular shaped ice in. Only broken ice will fit into the packaging. Secondly, the first time I place ice in it the roller was not cold at all what so ever. I actually had to place ice, let it melt and then place a second round of fresh ice in it for the roller ball to actually get cold. Thirdly, it has no fluid control at all what so ever. So when using this with ice or if the ice melts at all it will just profusely leak water all over where ever you’re applying it. So that rules out me being able to use this with massage oil.<br /><br />I do like the size of the jade roller and I feel like the concept is there it just needs better packaging. I can’t say I would recommend this because it feels cheap. There’s better jade roller options on the market that would provide better consistency with use, effectiveness and results.",0

I had heard that their fur was higher maintenance so I researched what we would need to best take care of him. I ended up ordering a big slicker style brush and this one. When we first got him, his fur was badly matted and he wasn't used to being brushed at all. We slowly got him used to being brushed and now we regularly use the slicker brush on him. This brush however, really pulls at his fur. I might have been tempted to think that it was just not the right brush for his fur, but on a recent attempt to trim his fur myself (rather than take him to the groomers) I found that I really needed this brush to get his curls combed out enough for the clippers to easily get through. It is incredibly slow going to even get through a small patch of his fur using this, let alone his entire body (he's medium/large). I'm thinking that we may just need to stick to the professional groomer for most haircuts and I'll just stick to the in-between appointment trims. So maybe it's me or maybe it's this comb or? The other issue I have with this comb is that the actual comb part comes apart from the wood handle. It's not ideal, but it does go back together and it's able to be used, so...?",0

I’ve been using this ceramide serum after cleansing and follow with my face cream, but it also layers well with my favorite staples, such as a Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serum (followed by my moisturizer).<br /><br />I like that this ceramide serum doesn’t appear to have any harsh ingredients, and it feels soothing and gentle to my skin. I’ve used it about a week so far and it adds noticeable hydration that isn't heavy, greasy or sticky, and my normally sensitive skin is calm and comfortable.

It is important to call out that since it does not have sulfates (which is the most common ingredient in regular shampoo to clean the scalp but can be harsh), you will need to scrub your scalp a bit more with your fingers tips (this is the same with any sulfate free shampoo).<br /><br />Overall rating due to broken pump: 4.5 rounding up to 5<br /><br />Full Ingredient List: Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe Vera) Leaf Juice*, Rosa Centifolia (Organic Rose Hydrosol)* Flower Water, Sodium Cocoate (Saponified Coconut) Oil, Vegetarian Glycerin, Plant Cellulose, Citrus Aurantium Sinensis (Orange) Fiber, Coffea Arabica (Green Coffee) Leaf/Seed Extract, Caffeine, Mentha (Mint) Extract, Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Biotin, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B6, Extracts of Camellia Sinensis (Organic Green Tea) Leaf*, Panax Ginseng (Ginseng) Extract, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem, Mentha (Mint) Essential Oil, Lonicera Caprifolium (Japanese Honeysuckle), Acetum Mali (Apple Cider Vinegar), Curcuma Longa (Tumeric) * Certified Organic",1

It helps sooth tissues & reduces uncomfortable problems. When clean up takes overly long due to pasty movements, the delicate tissue can get tiny tears that sting like nobodies business when cleaning up with witch hazel. This is where this cleansing lotion shines.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is weird putting lotion in that particular location, but it does make pasty clean up more comfortable.<br /><br />To assist healing & other minor back door problems, I recommend finishing up with WholeNest Less Than A Day - Hemorrhoid Relief Essential Oil Serum ( https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7LYFBDR ). I was skeptical, but it does really work.<br /><br />Regarding my Lady Garden, I haven't used this product for cleaning my Lady Garden.

This review is for: [SKIN&LAB] Barrierderm Milky Serum | Infused with Milk Ceramide Complex, Squalane, and Panthenol to ...<br /><br />I have used products from Skin & Lab before and liked most of them, and this serum is no exception. I was coming off of a different moisturizer that really irritated my skin, so I introduced this serum slowly. I started using it only once a day and once that previous irritation cleared up I moved up to twice a day.<br /><br />This serum is somewhere in between watery and a cream. The glass bottle is opaque and the serum does dispense as  milky-looking. It has no scent that I can detect. The dropper dispenses enough for about half my face, so I've been using two droppers per application. It has soothed my skin, clearing up my previous Rosacea break out and smoothing out my skin. I have an oily t-zone and a super dry chin this winter,  and all of that seems to be gone now.<br /><br />Due to these cold, breezy winter months, I have been using a moisturizer over this serum. I suspect that in the summer months, I might not even need to do that.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to continued use of this product and when it's gone I will most likely buy more. The price is affordable and this works wonderfully on my dry, winter skin.",1

I only stopped because my skin was sensitive and I guess it doesn't like the mixture of this stuff so I rinsed with a warm cloth and was left with SUPER soft skin and an obvious makeup line.

Although this does have a nice heavy, metal handle, the balls are PLASTIC. Stating in the title that it's a ""Metal Facial Roller"" is misleading because there are models where everything is indeed metal. In the description, it also says ""our facial roller tool is High quality metal material"". Ummmm... that's JUST THE HANDLE. The models we've tried with plastic balls had the fake metal paint water off, and some of them even crack after a while, so this is important in determining quality of the tool and the price that it should command. Most of the ones with plastic are priced around $8-10, while the all metal ones are $24-30. That being said, the price of this one might seem like a good deal if you think it's an all metal model - but it is actually overpriced for the plastic-ball-model.",0

This conditioner can be used on almost every leather except suede, Nubuck or rough out. It is wax based and oil based so it will darken the color of your leather a couple of shades. That said I did like it a lot, there is no weird smell it is easy to apply, it penetrates real well and pretty fast. The scuff covering is fair, it does make your leather water repellent not waterproof. Based on the characteristics of this conditioner I would use it on daily wear shoes, boots and leather goods. I would not use it much on work boots not that it is a bad product but for work boots I like stronger waterproofing qualities and I wouldn’t waste this good product on nasty dirty work boots. If you want to keep it safe and are bothered by Leather darkening a bit, use bick 4 a good safe product but it is a lighter conditioner and requires more frequent applications. If you are not bothered by the darkening of the leather and want a deep natural penetrating conditioner that works exceptionally well go for this one.
